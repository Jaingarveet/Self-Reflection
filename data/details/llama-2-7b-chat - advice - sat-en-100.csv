","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately reflect the central tension between the two passages.

The correct answer is choice C: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position. In Passage 1, Douglas accuses Lincoln of violating the law of God by criticizing the Constitution, while in Passage 2, Lincoln argues that Douglas misinterprets his position by claiming that he seeks to abolish the Constitution. This central tension between the two passages highlights the disagreement between Douglas and Lincoln on the issue of slavery and the Constitution.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

Upon re-reading the passage, I realized that the narrator portrays the Quabarl children as unusually creative and intelligent.

","  Topic: English
Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this ""civilization"" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

The central claim of the passage is:

C: the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.

Explanation:
The passage argues that the procession of educated men has been a male-dominated institution, and that this monopoly on power has had significant consequences for society. The author suggests that women have been excluded from this procession and that this exclusion has had a profound impact on their ability to participate in the institutions of English society. The passage also implies that the male-dominated nature of this procession has contributed to the perpetuation of inequality and the lack of representation of women's perspectives in society. Therefore, the central claim of the passage is that the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects, and that it is important for women to challenge this status quo and work towards greater representation and inclusion.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

The passage describes how Ken Dial's observation of young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds running along behind their parents led him to design a project to measure how baby game birds learned to fly. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species, and his experiments showed that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, which led to the discovery of WAIR (wing-assisted incline running). This discovery led Ken to reconsider the tree-down theory, and he found that WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, stating that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery in the Constitution included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Passage 1 suggests the opposite - that the Constitution did anticipate the Union's expansion into western territories, which would include new states that could be either free or slave states. This means that the Constitution did provide a means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states, by allowing for the possibility of new states being admitted to the Union with different slave laws. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.

Passage 1 suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery in the Constitution were not based on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth, as option (D) suggests. Instead, the Constitution allowed for the possibility of new states being admitted to the Union with different slave laws, which suggests that the founders of the US government were aware of the potential for economic growth without relying on slavery. Therefore, this option is not supported by Passage 1.

Finally, option (A) is not supported by Passage 1, as there is no indication in the passage that the Constitution included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states. Instead, the passage suggests that the Constitution did provide a means for reconciling these differences through the possibility of new states being admitted to the Union with different slave laws.

Upon reviewing my previous answer, I realized that I made a mistake in selecting the correct pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA. The correct pair is (C) $17.3 \%$ and $32.8 \%$.

Explanation:

The table shows the base composition of DNA for various organisms, including sea urchin. According to the table, the percentage of adenine in sea urchin DNA is $17.3 \%$, and the percentage of thymine is $32.8 \%$. Therefore, the pair of base percentages that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question is (C) $17.3 \%$ and $32.8 \%$.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer because it gives the percentage of cytosine (17.3\%) in sea urchin DNA and the percentage of guanine (17.7\%) in sea urchin DNA. Their near similar pairing supports the authors' proposal that possible pairings of nitrogenous bases are ""adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine"" (line 35).Choices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Choice $B$ (cytosine and thymine), Choice $\mathrm{C}$ (cytosine and adenine), and Choice $\mathrm{D}$ (guanine and adenine) are incorrect because they show pairings of nitrogenous bases that do not compose a similar percentage of the bases in sea urchin DNA.",C,A,0,1615,185,1800,

As I read through the passages, I noticed that the author is discussing the issue of slavery and its relationship to the expansion of the Union. The author argues that the Union can exist indefinitely if each state follows the principles of state rights and state sovereignty, and that the emigration from the old world will require the acquisition of new territory. The author also notes that the different institutions of the states are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union, but that the element of slavery has produced quarrels and difficulties.

Based on this analysis, I concluded that the correct answer is option A, ""the expansion of the Union."" This answer choice aligns with the author's argument that the Union can exist indefinitely if each state follows the principles of state rights and state sovereignty, and that the emigration from the old world will require the acquisition of new territory.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy over slavery has historically been ""excited by the effort to spread [slavery] into new territory,"" as in the case of Missouri, Texas, and ""the territory acquired by the Mexican War.""

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Question: Throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is

Answer: B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Explanation:
Throughout the passage, the narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing the details of the ink shop, such as the dark wood floors, the cleanliness of the shop, and the display cases of inksticks. She also observes the way Father speaks to the customer, highlighting the quality of the inksticks and the importance of the ink-making process. This suggests that the narrator is attuned to her immediate surroundings and able to notice details that might otherwise go unnoticed.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",,A,0,1394,1127,2521,

Therefore, the author of Passage 2 expresses some concerns about a concept discussed in Passage 1.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 does not refute the central claim of Passage 1 ; both authors agree there are possible benefits to space mining.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice A, ""The corrupting influence of a materialistic society,"" as the best description of a major theme in the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not accurate. The passage does not suggest that society is corrupting Eppie or Silas, but rather that Eppie's growing up and development are leading to changes in Silas' life and perspective.

The correct answer is choice C, ""The bittersweet brevity of childhood naïveté."" The passage highlights the contrast between Eppie's innocence and curiosity, and the growing complexity of Silas' thoughts and emotions as he navigates his role as a father. The passage also suggests that this transition is inevitable and natural, as Eppie grows and develops.

[REDACTED]","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom."" But after adopting Eppie, Silas became more interested in life outside his job: ""Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life."" A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

Reflection:

Initial answer: I initially answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice A, ""lower than the percentage that Hartmann found."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in a higher percentage of the surface covered with weeds, as these crops would compete with the weeds for resources and space.

Self-reflection:

I realized that I misunderstood the passage's description of the experiment and its results. I overlooked the fact that the passage states that the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds to the tune of over 80 percent, while the field plowed at night was only covered by weeds to the tune of about 2 percent. This suggests that the method of plowing at night is effective in reducing the number of weeds that emerge, which is the opposite of what I initially suggested.

In addition, I noticed that the passage does not provide any information about the type of crops planted on the two agricultural strips. This suggests that the method of plowing at night may be effective regardless of the type of crop planted, which further supports the correct answer.

Therefore, I changed my answer to choice B, ""higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.""","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",B,A,0,1661,303,1964,

Grimké argues that the rights of human beings are based on their moral nature, and that these rights are not determined by their race or gender.

I previously answered choice (C) nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed, but upon further analysis, I realized that the passage does not support this answer. The passage states that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. This suggests that the emotional aspect of touch is related to the activation of the insular cortex, which is only active when G.L.'s arm is gently brushed.

Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch.

This implies that the Filipinos are capable of organizing themselves and defending their rights, rather than being passive recipients of American governance. Additionally, the passage notes that the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources, which suggests that they are not willing to accept a subordinate role in the eyes of the American government.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (C) impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not primarily focus on the character's memories of her aunt. Instead, it highlights the character's understanding of her father's ambitions and the value of their family's ink.

Therefore, the best summary of the passage is choice C, ""A character comes to understand her father's ambitions while visiting her family's ink shop."" This choice accurately reflects the character's growth and development throughout the passage, as she learns to appreciate the quality and craftsmanship of her family's ink.

Answer:
Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, ""I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way."" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator's surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice (C) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (A) Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research. Ken Dial's research focused on understanding how young birds learn to fly, and he designed his experiments to observe how baby game birds learned to fly. His central assumption was that the acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This assumption is supported by the observation that all the species Ken Dial studied in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators, and only used the ground for feeding and traveling. By studying how young birds learn to fly, Ken Dial aimed to gain insights into the evolution of flight in birds.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: has renounced all desire for money.

The passage states that as Eppie grows and develops, Silas' ""soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness"" (para. 45). This suggests that Silas is becoming more open to new experiences and perspectives, including the idea of accepting help from others. Additionally, the passage notes that Silas is ""puzzled"" by Eppie's mischievous behavior, indicating that he is struggling to navigate this new aspect of their relationship (para. 65).

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society.

In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves.

I previously answered choice (A) Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

Tocqueville's views on gender roles in society are complex and nuanced. While he does acknowledge that there are natural differences between men and women, he also recognizes that these differences do not necessarily determine an individual's proper position in society. Tocqueville argues that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to, and that each individual should have the liberty of choice to pursue their own interests and abilities.

On the other hand, Mill's views on individual liberty and the proper position of women in society are more straightforward. Mill believes that each individual should have the freedom to pursue their own interests and abilities, regardless of their gender. He argues that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men, and that their position in society should be determined by their abilities and interests, rather than by their sex.

Based on this analysis, the best answer to the question is choice (B) Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by their economic class, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.

In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",,A,0,1527,341,1868,

The author notes that they have looked at the procession from a distance for years, but now they are part of it themselves, and this realization makes a difference. The bridge serves as a symbol of the continuity of this legacy and the author's place within it.

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Question: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident. The narrator's encounter with Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a pivotal moment in the passage, as it marks the beginning of the narrator's obsession with reading and his desire to become a writer. The passage highlights the impact that this book had on the narrator's life, as he read it repeatedly and became convinced that he wanted to do the same thing as Mr. Dickens. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) depiction of the narrator's father.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",B,A,0,1317,989,2306,

I previously answered question 1 as follows:
Action: Answer(""C"")
However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.
Here's my reasoning:
Passage 1 mentions that the first space miners may enrich themselves, but also hopes to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth. This suggests that the resources extracted from the moon and asteroids may become more valuable as they become scarce on Earth. This is explicitly stated in Passage 2, which mentions that the emerging off-world economy may value resources differently than those on Earth. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.

[REDACTED]","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet.

Meanwhile Passage 1 suggests that water mined from space may be more valuable than metals or other earth elements when creating an ""off-plant economy"" lines 25-30).Choice B is incorrect because neither passage discusses, either implicitly or explicitly, the need for space mining to be inexpensive.

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the data provided in the table do not necessarily support this claim. While it is true that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, this does not necessarily mean that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

The table only provides information on the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen, and does not provide information on the severity of the infection or the timing of the infection. It is possible that the colonies with colony collapse disorder were already weakened by other factors, such as nutritional deficiencies or pesticide exposure, which made them more susceptible to infection with varroa mites.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder."" This answer choice acknowledges that the data provided in the table do support the authors' claim, but also recognizes that other factors may be at play in the colonies with colony collapse disorder.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer.

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov's experiment demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, which supports Hodick and Sievers's model.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model.

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Question: Throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is

Answer: B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Explanation:
Throughout the passage, the narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing the details of the ink shop, such as the dark wood floors, the cleanliness of the shop, and the display cases of inksticks. She also observes the way Father speaks to the customer, highlighting the quality of the inksticks and the importance of the ink-making process. This suggests that the narrator is attuned to her immediate surroundings and able to notice details that might otherwise go unnoticed.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen."" She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family's ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before. Choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the narrator isn't portrayed as sympathetic to the needs of others (choice (C)or anxious about her responsibilities (choice D).",,B,0,1394,1127,2521,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option A: founding and history of the United States. However, upon further reflection, I realize that both passages actually focus more on the idealism and principles of American society, rather than its founding or history. Passage 1 emphasizes the idea of America as a ""noble land"" with a ""divinely logical"" history, while Passage 2 highlights the importance of self-government and the love of liberty in the Filipino people. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: idealism that permeates many aspects of American society.

Answer: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge expresses admiration for the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society, but Bryan doesn't.",D,A,0,1416,141,1557,

  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered question 45 incorrectly, selecting choice (C) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (B) - It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.

Lincoln's argument in Passage 2 suggests that the controversy over slavery has been exacerbated by the efforts to spread it into new territory. He notes that there has been relative peace on the slavery question when it has been limited to its current bounds, and that the trouble and convulsion have only occurred when there have been attempts to spread it over more territory. Therefore, the best answer is (B) - It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.

[REDACTED]","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Lincoln never attributes the controversy over slavery to differences in religion or social values from one state to another.",,B,0,1388,183,1571,

","Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question as follows:

""B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that conserving calcium reserves is an advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers. Instead, the passage highlights the importance of maintaining a high concentration of calcium ions in order to close the trap. Therefore, the correct answer is:

""D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.""

Explanation:
The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close. If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost. This suggests that the plant's requirement for multiple triggers helps to prevent it from closing before capturing its prey.

In contrast, options A, B, and C do not align with the information provided in the passage. Option A is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about identifying the species of the prey. Option B is also not supported, as the passage does not mention anything about conserving the plant's calcium reserves. Option C is also not relevant, as the passage does not suggest that safeguarding the plant's energy supply is an advantage of its requirement for multiple triggers.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",,C,0,1382,322,1704,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""describe a culture."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as stated in option C. The speaker is expressing surprise and amusement at the young man's bold move and is curious about the young man's intentions. The use of phrases such as ""I think you should go,"" ""How am I involved?"", and ""Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?"" indicate that the speaker is skeptical and curious about the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, ""question a suggestion.""","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1560,150,1710,
