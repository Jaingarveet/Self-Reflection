Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
All the options given can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Steel cans and glass bottles can be melted down and reshaped multiple times without losing their quality. Paper and plastic, on the other hand, degrade each time they are recycled.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost is formed when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas to a solid, without becoming a liquid first. This process is known as deposition, which is a type of sublimation.

After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought: 
The researchers can strengthen their conclusions by having an independent lab retest the antibiotic. This would help eliminate any potential bias and confirm the initial findings, thus providing a stronger basis for their conclusions.

  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Thought: 
All the options given are influenced by both genetics and environment. However, intelligence is generally considered to be less heritable than the other traits listed. It is influenced by a complex interplay of both genetic and environmental factors.

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves repeating experiments to ensure that the results are not due to experimental error. If the results consistently do not match the hypothesis, then the hypothesis may need to be revised.
