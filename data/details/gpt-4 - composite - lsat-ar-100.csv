  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","Thought: 
The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the restaurant nearest to the pharmacy can't be more than two spaces away from it. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that maintains this distance between the pharmacy and the nearest restaurant.

From the conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf.

Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf because if they were on the top shelf, K would have to be on the middle shelf, and there would be 4 books on the top shelf, which is not allowed. Since F and M are on the bottom shelf, and O is higher than L, O must be on a shelf higher than M.

This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 1 or bay 6. It also cannot be bay 5, because then the bay holding textiles would have to be bay 6, and there would be no lower-numbered bay for the bay holding produce. Therefore, the bay holding livestock could be bay 2, bay 3, or bay 4.

Given that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, it means that T is performed immediately before F. This satisfies the first condition. 
Since T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, there are four compositions before T and F, and two compositions after them. This satisfies the second condition. 
O cannot be performed fifth because T is performed fifth, so O must be performed first. This satisfies the third condition. 
The eighth composition can be either L or H, this doesn't affect S's position. 
P is performed at some time before S, so S cannot be performed first, second, or third because P must be performed before it and O is already performed first. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, S cannot be performed second.

Given that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia must lead a session on Friday because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and the only afternoon session left is on Friday, so Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and the only day with two sessions left is Wednesday, so Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan cannot lead a session on Friday. The only session left for Lan is Thursday morning.

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so if Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target can be 1 or 2 days.

  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.
","Choices:
  A: Manx are featured on day 3.
  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.
  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.
  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.
","Thought: 
Given the conditions, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, 2, or any day with Rottweilers. Since the Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, they could be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. Since no breed featured on day 1 can be featured on day 7, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, the Himalayans must be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. This means that the Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 (choice C), and the Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 (choice E). This leaves choices A, B, and D. Since the Manx and Siamese can be featured on any day that does not feature the Himalayans, either could be true. However, since the Himalayans are featured on day 6, choice D is possible. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.

","Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh
","Thought: 
Given that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F because O would have to be performed immediately after F, which is not possible. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R. This means that F must be performed after O and T. Since O is performed either first or fifth, and T is performed immediately after O, then F must be performed either third or seventh. However, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, F cannot be performed third. Therefore, F must be performed seventh.
