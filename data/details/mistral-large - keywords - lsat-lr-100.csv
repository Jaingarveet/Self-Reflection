The flaw in Morgenstern's argument is that it fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance. Just because Brooks is unhappy in his current job does not necessarily mean that he would be happier unemployed or in a different job.

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice ""E,"" which suggests that the argument assumes that the presence of certain substances (hormones) in tears causes emotional stress. However, the argument does not make this assumption. Instead, it assumes that the shedding of tears causes a reduction in emotional stress. The correct answer is choice ""A,"" which points out that the argument overlooks the possibility that other factors could contribute to reducing emotional stress. The logical reasoning error in the argument is an assumption error, specifically a causation error.",,A,E,0,574,170,744,

I previously misunderstood the argument's main point and the role of the statement ""That we should learn the lessons of history"" in the argument. The argument does not take this statement for granted as false, nor does it aim to discredit it. Instead, the argument raises a problem with the idea that we should learn the lessons of history, namely that it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons and apply them to new situations. Therefore, the statement sets out a problem that the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.

The argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights. However, this assumption may not be valid if cocker spaniels are more likely to stray from their owners than other breeds, or if there are more stray dogs found in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city.

To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners (choice A). This information would help determine whether the assumption that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights is valid.

Reflection:
Previously, I may have misunderstood the argument and focused on the wrong assumption. I may have thought that the argument was assuming that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is more likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights than to someone in any other neighborhood. However, this is not the assumption that the argument is making. The argument is assuming that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights.

To avoid this error in the future, I will carefully read the argument and identify the assumption that the argument is making. I will then consider what information would be most useful to evaluate that assumption. In this case, the assumption is that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights, so it would be most useful to know whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners.
