  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
","Thought:
Let's denote the original price of the computer as x. After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x. Then, an 8% sales tax is applied to the discounted price, which is 0.08 \* 0.8x = 0.064x. The total amount Alma paid is the discounted price plus the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.064x = 0.864x. We are given that the total amount Alma paid is p, so we have the equation 0.864x = p. To find the original price x in terms of p, we need to solve for x.

Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.864:

x = p / 0.864

We can simplify the denominator by multiplying it by 100/100 to get rid of the decimal:

x = p / (86.4/100)

x = p / (0.8 \* 1.08)

Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of p is x = p / (0.8 \* 1.08), which corresponds to choice (D).","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are retry. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$. However, this is retry because $8 \%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them. The expression in choice $C$ results from assigning $p$ to represent the original price of the laptop, rather than to the amount Alma paid to the cashier.",D,D,1,453,308,761,

The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites.

To find the value of $a$ for which the system has no solution, we can use the concept of linear independence. Two equations are linearly independent if they do not represent the same line. If they are linearly dependent, they either represent the same line (infinite solutions) or parallel lines (no solution).

To check for linear dependence, we can compare the slopes of the two equations. If the slopes are equal, the equations are linearly dependent.

The slope of the first equation is $-3$. The slope of the second equation is $-\frac{a}{2}$.

Setting the slopes equal to each other, we get $-3 = -\frac{a}{2}$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = 6$.

However, we need to check if this value of $a$ results in parallel lines or the same line. To do this, we can compare the y-intercepts of the two equations. If the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution.

The y-intercept of the first equation is $6$. The y-intercept of the second equation is $4$.

Since the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution when $a = 6$.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $a x+2 y=4$ are represented by the expression $-\frac{a}{2}$ and the point $(0,2)$, respectively. The value of $a$ can be found by setting the two slopes equal to each other, which gives $-\frac{a}{2}=3$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by -2 gives $a=-6$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

The mean is the average of all the values, so removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the mean.
The median is the middle value when the data is sorted, so removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median since it is not in the middle.
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values, so removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is retry. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches.
