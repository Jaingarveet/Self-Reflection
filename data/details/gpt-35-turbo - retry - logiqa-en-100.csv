The argument is that the proportion of cars with airbags is higher than that of cars without airbags in car accidents, so installing an airbag in a car does not make the car owner safer. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the proportion of cars with airbags is the same as the proportion of cars without airbags. The loophole in the argument is that it does not consider the total number of cars with airbags and without airbags on the road.

The statement mentions that to maintain economic development, domestic enterprises must constantly strengthen their competitiveness. To maintain social stability, social security systems such as pensions, medical care, and unemployment must be established and improved. Enterprises need to pay a certain percentage of social insurance premiums for employees every year to establish and improve the social security system. However, paying such a proportion of social insurance premiums for employees every year will reduce the competitiveness of the enterprise.
