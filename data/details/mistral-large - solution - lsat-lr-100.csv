  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city
  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood
  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are
","Thought:
The argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights. However, this assumption could be flawed if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.

To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are (choice E). If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then it would be more likely that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. However, if residents of Flynn Heights are not more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is weaker.

The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.

  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
","Thought:
The argument assumes that most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes after the move to Ocean View. This assumption is based on the fact that most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. However, the argument does not provide information about the current commute times of Acme employees. Therefore, the argument requires assuming that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

Self-reflection:
I initially answered this question incorrectly because I focused on the assumption that the move would not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees. However, this assumption is not necessary to make the argument. The argument is based on the future commute times of Acme employees after the move to Ocean View. Therefore, the argument requires assuming that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

","Reflection:
Upon reviewing the question, I realized that I initially misunderstood the prompt. The question asks for the strongest counter to Tamara's objection, not the strongest argument in favor of Patricia's original claim.

Solution:
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the wealthy were not representative of the general population or that the squeaky floors were not specifically designed to warn against ninjas.

Choice C is the strongest counter because it shows that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which weakens Tamara's argument that many Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.

","Thought:
The information provided states that until 1985, the cabin air in planes was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, it has been replenished once every hour. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in planes has increased.
The question asks which statement is most strongly supported by this information. The correct answer is that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This is because in 1980, the air was replenished more frequently, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide.

Explanation:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. This is the most strongly supported statement among the given choices.",,B,C,0,881,161,1042,
