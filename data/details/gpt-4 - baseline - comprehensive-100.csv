The shop assistant needs to earn an additional $1000 (1500 - 500) from the 5% commission on sales. 
To find the sales amount, we divide the needed amount by the commission rate: 1000 / 0.05 = $20000.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Let S be the total monthly salary and x be the monthly sales, hence
S = 500 + 5% * x
Find sales x so that S = 1500, hence
1500 = 500 + 5% * x = 500 + 0.05 x

  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Thought: 
The length of the fence is composed of the width of the pickets and the space between them. 
Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. 
There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets, the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches. 
So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1). 
To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). 
Action: 
First, simplify the equation: 1/2x + 6(x-1) = 1/2x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.
Then, convert to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 = (13x - 12) / 24.
So, the answer is E: (13x - 12) / 24.","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12

The economics professor's conclusion is that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza. This conclusion can be properly drawn if we assume that any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. This assumption directly supports the professor's conclusion.

The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left side must equal the coefficients on the right side.
Therefore, $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
We also know that $a + b = 8$.
We can solve for a and b using the equations $ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$.
The solutions are $(a, b) = (5, 3)$ or $(a, b) = (3, 5)$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 35$ or $c = 21$.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method. Here, I will use the elimination method. 
First, I will multiply the second equation by 3 and the first equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal.

3x + 4y = -23
6y - 3x = -57
Adding these two equations together, we get:
10y = -80
Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
y = -8
Substituting y = -8 into the first equation, we get:
3x + 4*(-8) = -23
3x - 32 = -23
3x = 9

The population decreases by 10 percent every 20 years, which means it retains 90 percent (or 0.9) of its population every 20 years.

In this case, the rate of decay happens every 20 years, so we need to adjust the time in the formula by dividing t by 20. 
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9.

Substituting these values into the expression $h(5)-h(3)$ produces $32-8=24$.Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $5-3$, not of $h(5)-h(3)$. Choice B is incorrect.

A line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If this line passes through the origin, then the slope must be the same when x=0. So, we need to solve the equation (32-k)/(k-2) = 0.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

To find the value of x - y, we can subtract the second equation from the first one.

Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$.

The population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015. So, the population of City X in 2015 is 120,000 * 1.2 = 144,000.
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, the population of City Y in 2015 is also 144,000.
The population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. So, the population of City Y in 2010 is 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000.
