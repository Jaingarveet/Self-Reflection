  E: None of these
","Thought:
Let's set up an equation to represent the given information.
The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales, which can be written as:
S = 500 + 0.05 * sales
We are given that the monthly salary reaches $1500, so we can substitute S with 1500:
1500 = 500 + 0.05 * sales
Now, let's solve for sales:
1500 - 500 = 0.05 * sales
1000 = 0.05 * sales
sales = 1000 / 0.05
sales = 20000
Action: Answer(""D"")","Let S be the total monthly salary and x be the monthly sales, hence
S = 500 + 5% * x
Find sales x so that S = 1500, hence
1500 = 500 + 5% * x = 500 + 0.05 x
Solve for x
x = (1500 - 500) / 0.05 = $20000

","Thought:
The width of each picket is 1/2 inch.
The space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.
Therefore, the total width of each pair of pickets and the space between them is 1/2 + 6 + 1/2 = 7 inches.
There are x pickets, so there are x-1 spaces between them.
The total length of the fence is the sum of the widths of all the pickets and spaces, which is x*(1/2) + (x-1)*7.
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches

This is possible. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 2. Siamese can be featured on day 2.
B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
This is not possible. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 7. Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they can be featured on day 7. However, Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, and Himalayans cannot be featured on the same day as Rottweilers.
C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.

  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.
  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.
  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.

The passage states that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person.
This implies that different cats may trigger allergies in different people.
The passage also states that no cat is incapable of provoking allergic reactions.
Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.

","Thought:
The passage describes how Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP used a strategic and methodological approach to public interest law. They carefully selected cases, used sociological and psychological statistics, and focused on the plaintiff's public appeal and credibility.
The question asks for the pair of tactics that is most analogous to Marshall's strategies.
Option A aligns with Marshall's approach. Pursuing a case based on its potential legal implications for a large class of related cases is similar to Marshall's focus on cases with broad impact. Additionally, using testimony by a noted medical authority to support the claim of widespread medical problems caused by pollution mirrors Marshall's use of sociological and psychological statistics to demonstrate the public harms of discriminatory laws.
Option B is not analogous. Accepting a case based on its practical urgency and assigning it to the most well-known members of the firm do not align with Marshall's emphasis on strategic selection and careful evaluation.
Option C focuses on pursuing cases in favorable courts and with judges who uphold constitutional principles. While Marshall considered the potential impact of each decision, his primary focus was not on the specific court or judge but on the broader social and legal implications of the case.
Option D emphasizes accepting a case based on the plaintiff's needs and orchestrating pretrial publicity. While Marshall considered the plaintiff's public appeal, his primary focus was on choosing cases with strong legal arguments and the potential for broad impact. Additionally, the passage does not mention any use of pretrial publicity.
Option E describes thorough research of precedents and consultations with defense lawyers. While Marshall certainly engaged in legal research and may have had some interactions with opposing counsel, the passage emphasizes his focus on strategic case selection, impactful arguments, and the plaintiff's public image.

This competition would have likely reduced the growth of the weeds, resulting in a lower percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",A,A,1,1343,127,1470,

Expanding the left side of the equation gives $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$.
Comparing coefficients, we have $ab=15$, $7a+2b=c$, and $14=14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ using substitution or elimination.
Using substitution, we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$: $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation $ab=15$, we get $a(8-a)=15$, which simplifies to $a^2-8a+15=0$.
Factoring, we get $(a-3)(a-5)=0$, so $a=3$ or $a=5$.
If $a=3$, then $b=5$, and $c=7a+2b=31$.
If $a=5$, then $b=3$, and $c=7a+2b=41$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

* $P(t)$ is the population after $t$ years
* $P_0$ is the initial population (50,000 in this case)
* $r$ is the rate of decrease (10% or 0.1)

$P(t) = P_0 \cdot (1 - r)^{\frac{t}{20}}$
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$.
