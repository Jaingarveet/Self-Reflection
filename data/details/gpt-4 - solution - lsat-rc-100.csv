","Thought: 
The third paragraph discusses the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. The critics argue that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western, often non-scientific cultures, is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a non-scientific culture would be objectionable to these critics.

","Thought: 
The author's connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the idea that larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business. This leads to an industry being dominated by a few players, creating a monopoly. 
Choice D undermines this connection by suggesting that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This implies that increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power in all industries.
