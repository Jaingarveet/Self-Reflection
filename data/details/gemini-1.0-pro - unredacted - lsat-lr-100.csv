**1. Conclusion:** Some books published by Garden Path are flawed.
**2. Premise 1:** Some gardening books published by Garden Path recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden on a site.
**3. Premise 2:** These books do not explain the difference between hot and cold composting.
**4. Assumption:** An explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting.
**5. Required Assumption?** Yes, the argument requires this assumption to connect the premises to the conclusion. Without this assumption, the argument would not be valid. If an explanation of the basics of composting does not necessarily include an explanation of hot and cold composting, then the books could still be flawed for not explaining the basics of composting, even if they explain the difference between hot and cold composting.

","## Action: Answer(""E"")
**Explanation:**
The argumentative technique employed in the passage is **conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion.**
Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:
1. **Factic:** The statement that someone who has not yielded is unyielding.
2. **Conditional Advocacy:** The author suggests using the term ""unyielding"" only if one wants to make the accusation stick.
3. **Grounds:** The reason for this conditional advocacy is that it leads to an argument where accepting the premise (that the person has not yielded) logically necessitates accepting the conclusion (that the person is unyielding).
4. **Premise-Conclusion Relationship:** The key point is that one cannot consistently accept the premise that the person has not yielded while denying the conclusion that they are unyielding. This makes the argument logically sound and difficult to refute.
Therefore, option E accurately describes the argumentative technique used in the passage.

  D: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.

","Thought: 
The university president's argument is that if the university does not increase its enrollment, it will be forced to reduce spending. This reduction in spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education provided by the university. Therefore, the university must market its programs more aggressively in order to increase enrollment and avoid reducing spending.
The conclusion of the argument relies on the assumption that reducing spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the argument, but it is implied by the president's statement that ""we will be forced to reduce spending next year if we do not increase our enrollment.""

","Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas.

Explanation: 
The argument assumes that even without a significant pay raise, employees will still choose to live near their workplace in Ocean View, despite the financial hardship it may cause. This aligns with option E, which states that the move will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise, implying that employees' financial constraints will remain unchanged. 
I have incorporated the learnings from my previous error and focused on the crucial information about housing affordability. I have also avoided making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.

","Thought: 
The information provided states that the rate at which cabin air is replenished in commercial airliners has decreased since 1985. This suggests that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air has increased since 1985.
The information provided also states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. This suggests that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
However, the information provided does not state that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished. Therefore, I cannot conclude that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower in 1980 than it is today on a similar flight.
