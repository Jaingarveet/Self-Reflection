Necrosis is a form of cell death characterized by the premature death of cells in living tissue by autolysis.
Enzymatic digestion is the process by which enzymes break down large molecules into smaller ones.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Necrosis: Type of cell death associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents culminating in the dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The enzymes responsible for digestion of cells may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cell themselves and from lysosomes of leucocytes recruited as pa of inflammation. The leaked cellular contents often elicit an inflammatory response.

Action: Answer(""C"")","The value of radiography as a diagnostic aid in orthodontics was proclaimed by W.A. Price in 1990, 5 years after the discovery of X-rays. 
The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

All antithyroid drugs can cross placenta so risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitre is always there. Both carbimazole and propylthiouracil can be used during pregnancy, but propylthiouracil is the drug of choice because its greater protein binding allows low doses of propylthiouracil to be transferred across the placenta and therefore less chance of hypothyroidism. 
The lowest effective dose of propylthiouracil should be given and it is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester since TSH Receptor antibodies tend to decline in pregnancy.

","Choices:

  C: Cystic fibrosis
  D: Intestinal malrotation
","Action: Answer(""A"") 
**Explanation:**
The barium enema shows a microcolon, which is a characteristic finding in congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease). The intestinal biopsy confirms the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, which is diagnostic of this condition.
**Key points:**
* Congenital aganglionic megacolon is a birth defect that affects the large intestine.
* It is caused by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, which are responsible for controlling the movement of stool through the intestines.
* This results in a functional obstruction of the colon, leading to symptoms such as delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting.
* The diagnosis is confirmed by barium enema and intestinal biopsy.
**Differential diagnosis:**
* Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: This condition causes a narrowing of the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. It can present with similar symptoms to congenital aganglionic megacolon, but the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would be different.
* Cystic fibrosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It can cause meconium ileus, a blockage of the small intestine with thick, sticky meconium. However, the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would not be consistent with congenital aganglionic megacolon.
* Intestinal malrotation: This is a birth defect that occurs when the intestines do not rotate properly during fetal development. It can cause intestinal obstruction, but the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would be different from those seen in congenital aganglionic megacolon.",a.

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of malignancy of the stomach.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Ans. A: Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A,A,1,283,23,306,

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country.2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role.3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat. Appointment of medical officers at state headquarters in order to make their monitoring role more effective;5. Research and training in the field of community mental health, substance abuse and child/ adolescent psychiatric clinics.",N,A,0,284,164,448,

Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease. Most small cell carcinomas have already spread at the time of presentation beyond the bounds of surgery and they are managed primarily by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy.

Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

","Thought: 
The clinical presentation is consistent with cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel.
The basic abnormality in cystic fibrosis is a decreased glycosylated chloride channel.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases that affects white populations (1/2000). The primary abnormality in patients with cystic fibrosis involves the epithelial transpo of chloride. Normally, binding of a ligand to a membrane surface receptor activates adenyl cyclase, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP. This in turn activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), causing it to open and release chloride ions. Sodium ions and water then follow the chloride ions to maintain the normal viscosity of mucus. The most common abnormality in patients with CF involves decreased glycosylation of the CFTR, which then does not become incorporated into the cell membrane. A lack of chloride channels then causes decreased chloride, sodium, and water secretion, all of which together results in a very thick mucus (the other name of CF is mucoviscidosis). These thick mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, causing fibrosis and cystic dilation of the ducts (hence the name cystic fibrosis). Decreased excretion of pancreatic lipase leads to malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea, which may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Thick mucus may also cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, a condition called meconium ileus. Abnormal mucus in the pulmonary tree leads to atelectasis, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. Obstruction of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles in males leads to sterility, while obstruction of the bile duct produces jaundice.

The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

  A: Loop of henle
  B: Collecting duct
  C: DCT
  D: PCT
","Choices:
  A: Loop of henle
  B: Collecting duct
  C: DCT
  D: PCT
","Thought: 
The loop of Henle is responsible for reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions, which helps to create a concentration gradient in the medulla.
The collecting duct is responsible for fine-tuning the urine's pH and concentration.
The DCT is responsible for reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions, as well as secreting potassium ions.
The PCT is responsible for reabsorbing glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules.
Action: Answer(""B"")","The cells of the proximal and distal tubules secrete hydrogen ions. Acidification also occurs in the collecting ducts. The reaction that is primarily responsible for H+ secretion in the proximal tubules is Na+-H+ exchange. Na is absorbed from the lumen of the tubule and H is excreted.

Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","Thought:
* Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, which is deficient in Parkinson's disease.
* Benserazide is an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase, which prevents the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain.
* Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, which increases dopamine levels by inhibiting its breakdown.
* Biperiden is a muscarinic antagonist, which blocks the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is increased in Parkinson's disease.
Action: Answer(""D"")",An antiparkinson medication is a type of drug which is intended to treat and relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Most of these agents act by either increasing dopamine activity or reducing acetylcholine activity in the central nervous system. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.,D,D,1,286,112,398,
