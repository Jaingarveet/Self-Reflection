","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.

Explanation:
The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in production costs. The average cost of producing an hour of film is significantly higher than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to recoup their investment through ticket sales, which requires a larger audience. In contrast, television executives have a lower production cost, which allows them to focus on creating high-quality content that appeals to a smaller audience. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.",,C,D,0,534,179,713,

Question: The principles stated by the lawyer most strongly support which one of the following judgments?

Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
The lawyer's principles state that accessing information in computer files without securing authorization from the computer's owner is justified only if there exist reasonable grounds for believing that such a computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner.

Option (D) best aligns with these principles as it states that customs officials examined all of the files stored on a laptop computer confiscated from an importer whom they suspected of smuggling. Since there were reasonable grounds for believing that the computer had typically been used in the operation of the importer's legitimate business, the customs officials' action was justified.

Option (A) is incorrect as Rey did not have permission from the store owner to access the computer, and the principle states that authorization from the computer's owner is necessary for justified access.

Option (C) is incorrect as the police officer accessed files on Natalie's computer without her permission, and the principle states that permission from the computer's owner is necessary for justified access.

Option (B) is incorrect as the police officers did not have reasonable grounds for believing that the computer files contained evidence usable in a legal proceeding against the firm's owner, and therefore their action was not justified.

Option (E) is incorrect as the police officer accessed personal letters written by one of the company's employees, which are not data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the company's owner, and therefore the police officer's action was not justified.",,D,B,0,773,375,1148,

The principle that most helps to justify the judge's reasoning is (D) Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.

The defendant in the scenario admits noncompliance with national building codes, but argues that he was confused about whether national or local building codes applied to the area where he was building. However, as the judge points out, the defendant is charged with noncompliance with national codes, and therefore his excuse is unacceptable.

This principle holds that ignorance of the law is no excuse for noncompliance. If the defendant had been charged with noncompliance with local codes, his excuse might have been acceptable, as local codes may be less strict than national codes. However, since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his ignorance of the difference between the two is not a valid excuse.",,D,C,0,491,204,695,

The argument states that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information about a product unless they expect that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty. Therefore, the assumption that consumers who do not bother to acquire detailed information do not expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty is a logical conclusion.

Option A is incorrect because it states that rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information usually do not bother to acquire such information. This is not the conclusion of the argument, which is that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.

This is a contradiction of the argument, which states that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.

The principle that most helps to justify the reasoning in the art critic's argument is option B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.

The art critic argues that cars are utilitarian objects and do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them, therefore, Nan Paulsen's reviews of cars are not appropriate for the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism. This argument is based on the idea that criticism should reveal important truths about the culture that produced the object being reviewed, and cars do not possess this quality.

Option B supports this argument by stating that reviews cannot be considered criticism unless the objects being reviewed reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.

The correct answer is (D) Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.

Explanation:
The statement ""Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes"" weakens the argument that Carl is incompetent as a detective. This information suggests that Carl has a history of solving crimes in the past, which contradicts the argument that he is incompetent. It is possible that Carl's poor performance on the current police force is due to factors unrelated to his detective skills, such as a lack of resources or support. Therefore, this information weakens the argument that Carl is the most incompetent detective on the police force.",,D,A,0,523,206,729,

The correct answer is (C) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine. This is consistent with the idea that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

The other options do not explain the finding of the nicotine study:

* Option (A) is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.
* Option (B) is irrelevant to the study's findings. The study did not examine the number of cigarettes smoked per day, so it cannot be used to explain the finding that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.

","  The correct answer is (B) Even if only some of the thread and rope that is currently being made from nylon were instead made from cotton fiber, some environmental damage would be avoided.

Explanation:
The argument is that using cotton fiber instead of nylon would reduce environmental damage because the processing of nylon releases harmful gases. However, if only a small portion of the current nylon production is replaced by cotton fiber, the overall environmental impact would be limited. Therefore, option (B) weakens the argument by providing a counterexample of a situation where replacing a small portion of nylon production with cotton fiber would still have some environmental benefits.",,,C,0,577,152,729,

However, this is not a valid logical reasoning, as there may be exceptions or variations within the group that can affect the conclusion.",,,E,0,578,224,802,

  B: Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.

The statement ""cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains"" is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by providing a reason why recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised. The argument is that since cell-phone use is already bothersome on buses and trains, it would be even more disruptive and annoying on airplanes where passengers are more tightly packed and have limited options to move to another seat.

This choice suggests that lawmakers in those jurisdictions take into account the severity of the harm caused by a particular crime when determining the appropriate penalty. If the harm caused by theft is seen as equivalent to the harm caused by bribery, it is likely that lawmakers would mandate a similar penalty for both crimes.

Choices (A) and (B) are not directly relevant to the argument, as they do not address the specific context of the question.
