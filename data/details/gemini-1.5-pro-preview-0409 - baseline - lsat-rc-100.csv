  D: No particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

* **B:** While urgency and using well-known lawyers might be effective, they don't directly parallel Marshall's core strategies of carefully chosen test cases and evidence-based arguments.
* **C:**  Focusing on favorable courts and judges deviates from Marshall's focus on building strong cases based on evidence and precedent, regardless of the specific court or judge.
* **D:**  While plaintiff needs are a consideration, Marshall's primary focus was on the case's strategic value and the plaintiff's ability to represent the cause effectively. Pretrial publicity is not a direct parallel to his methods.
* **E:**  Researching precedents is standard legal practice, not unique to Marshall's approach. Consulting with defense lawyers for a pretrial settlement also doesn't align with his strategies.
