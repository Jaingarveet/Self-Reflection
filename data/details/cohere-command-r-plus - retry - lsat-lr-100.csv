  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.

This is because the argument states that once the company moves, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes, so we can assume that previously, their commutes were shorter. 

We cannot assume that all employees can afford housing near Milltown (choice A) nor that the chairperson's financial reasons for the move are good (choice B).

  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
","Thought: 
The science journalist's statements support the idea that the presence or absence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is indicative of the level of mixing of elements in its internal nuclear furnace, and by extension, the mass of the object.

Statement A: While it is true that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, the presence of lithium alone does not exclusively indicate a star with more mass than the Sun. Therefore, this option is not the most accurate conclusion.

Statement B: This statement is accurate according to the journalist's explanation. The presence of lithium indicates that the elements have not been completely mixed in the object's nuclear furnace, which is a characteristic of stars more massive than the Sun.

Statement C: This statement is false. A brown dwarf, by definition, is a substellar object that has not developed a fully functional nuclear furnace, which means its lithium is not consumed. Therefore, the absence of lithium is indicative of celestial objects beyond the brown dwarf stage of evolution.

Statement D: This statement is false. While stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, the presence of lithium does not exclusively indicate that an object is less massive than the Sun. There are stars more massive than the Sun that also have lithium due to incomplete mixing.

Statement E: This statement is supported by the explanation provided. Brown dwarfs are defined by their partially developed nuclear furnaces, which cannot fully consume lithium. Therefore, any object less massive than a brown dwarf would also lack the conditions to consume lithium.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
