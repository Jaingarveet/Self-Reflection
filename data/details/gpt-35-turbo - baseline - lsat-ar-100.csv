","Thought:
If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and H must be fourth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and H must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
If S is third, then Q must be first or second, which means G must be first or second, respectively. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, J must be third.

Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf.

If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can deduce that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. 
From the second condition, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Wednesday. 
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday as well, which violates the first condition. 
If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
