Action: Answer(""D"")","The value of radiography as a diagnostic aid in orthodontics was proclaimed by W.A. Price in 1990, 5 years after the discovery of X-rays. 
The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

Thought: 
Randomization is a process that ensures each participant has an equal and unknown chance of being assigned to any of the groups or receiving any of the treatments being compared.

Equal chances refer to the fact that all individuals have the same probability or likelihood of being assigned to a particular group or receiving a specific treatment. This equality ensures that no bias is introduced into the assignment process.

Unknown chances refer to the concept that neither the researchers nor the participants know in advance which individuals will be assigned to which groups or treatments. This uncertainty is crucial for minimizing potential bias and ensuring the integrity of the study results.

Type III hypersensitivity is a reaction mediated by immune complexes, which deposit in various tissues and activate the complement system, leading to inflammation. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis and glomerulonephritis.

","Choices:
  A: Infection
  B: Obstruction
  C: Fistula

","Reflection: I did not consider the anatomical location of the procedure and its potential complications. I should have considered that a cyst-gastrostomy involves creating a connection between the stomach and a pancreatic cyst, which increases the risk of specific complications due to the proximity of other organs and structures.

Correct answer reasoning: 
Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between the stomach and a pseudo pancreatic cyst to facilitate drainage. One major potential complication of this procedure is the formation of a fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two epithelial-lined organs or structures. In this case, it refers to an unwanted connection between the stomach and the cyst, or possibly between the cyst and other adjacent organs, such as the duodenum or pancreas. This can lead to leakage of digestive enzymes and contents, resulting in severe health consequences.
