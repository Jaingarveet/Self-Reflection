","Thought:
Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The area of a triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * base * height.
Since the two triangles are identical, we can set up the equation (1/2) * (x-4) * h = 70, where h is the height of each triangle.
Solving for h, we get h = 140 / (x-4).
The height of each triangle is also given by the Pythagorean theorem as sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2) = sqrt(8x - 16).
Equating the two expressions for h, we get 140 / (x-4) = sqrt(8x - 16).
Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get 8x^2 - 312x + 1960 = 0.
Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 19.55 or x = 15.95.
Since x represents the length of a side of the original square piece of cloth, we can discard the smaller solution and conclude that x = 19.55 feet.

Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Now, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 7/3 of the work.
Thus, the remaining work is (1 - 7/3) = 2/3 of the work.
Let's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.
So, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/12)*x of the work.
Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
(1/12)*x = 2/3
x = (2/3)/(1/12)
x = 8
Therefore, it will take Mr.Blue 8 days to complete the contract.
Action: Answer(""B"")","let x is amount of work to be done to paint one house.
So Brown's one day work is x/6, black's can do x/8 work in

If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she will need 10 letters. 
If she uses a pair of two different letters, she will need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first letter, and 1 letter out of 25 for the second letter (since the order of letters in a pair does not matter). This gives us 26*25/2 = 325 possible pairs. 
We need to find the smallest number of letters that can represent all 10 types of books uniquely. 
Action: Answer(""B"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

Let's assume the cost price of each bag of flour is x.
The selling price of each bag of flour is $100.
The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, which means he sells each bag of flour for $125.
The profit made on each bag of flour is $125 - $x.
We know that the grocer made a total profit of $3,000.
We can set up an equation to solve for x and then use that value to find the number of bags sold.
Equation: $3,000 = (125 - x) * n, where n is the number of bags sold.
Action: Answer(""C"") 24. 
Explanation:
$3,000 = (125 - x) * n
$3,000 = (125 - x) * n
$3,000/n = 125 - x
x = 125 - $3,000/n
The cost price of each bag of flour is $125 - $3,000/n.
We know that the selling price of each bag of flour is $100, so we can set up another equation to solve for n.
Equation: $125 - $3,000/n = $100
$25 = $3,000/n

Let's assume that the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x.
So, the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.
We can set up the equation 4/3 = (64 + x)/(40 + x) to solve for x.

Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.
Using the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

From the given information, we know that H+L = 2x and S/z = y.
We can express S in terms of H, L, and z as S = H + L + (z-2)A, where A is the average score of the remaining z-2 students.
We can express A in terms of S and z as A = S/z.
Substituting the above equations, we get S = 2x + (z-2)Ay.
We need to find S' which is the sum of all the scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers.
S' = S - H - L
Substituting the above equations, we get S' = 2x + (z-2)Ay - H - L
We know that H+L = 2x.
Substituting the above equation, we get S' = S - 2x.
Substituting the values of S and z, we get S' = zy - 2x.
Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy - 2x)/(z-2).","Highest: H

","Thought:
Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower be x.
Using trigonometry, we can write the following equations:
h/x = tan(45°) = 1
h/(x + vt) = tan(60°) = √3
where v is the speed of the car and t is the time taken to reach the base of the tower.
We need to find t.
Solving the above equations, we get:
x = h
x + vt = h/√3
Substituting x = h, we get:
h + vt = h/√3
t = (h/√3 - h)/v
We know that the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes.
Using trigonometry, we can write:
tan(60°) = h/(x + vt1)
where t1 is the time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.
Substituting x = h and t1 = 10 minutes, we get:
√3 = h/(h + 10v/√3)
Solving for h, we get:
h = 10v/(√3 - 1)
Substituting this value of h in the expression for t, we get:
t = 5(√3 + 1)
Action: Answer(""A"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100
Given, Selling Price = Rs. 27.50 and Profit Percentage = 10%

Cost Price = (100 / (100 + Profit Percentage)) x Selling Price
Cost Price = (100 / (100 + 10)) x 27.50
Cost Price = (100 / 110) x 27.50
Cost Price = 25
Now, if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, then the profit or loss percentage can be calculated as follows:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
Profit = 25.75 - 25

","Thought:
The outer surface of the hollow cube can be found by subtracting the volume of the inner cube from the volume of the outer cube.
The outer cube has dimensions 5cm x 5cm x 5cm, and the inner cube has dimensions 3cm x 3cm x 3cm.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface can be found by subtracting the number of smaller cubes that make up the inner surface from the total number of smaller cubes in the outer cube.
Action: 
The outer surface of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150 square cm.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150.
Each face of a smaller cube has an area of 1 square cm, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 150 x 6 = 900.
The number of faces that remain unpainted is 900 - 150 = 750.
Therefore, the answer is Answer(""None of the Above"").","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180
Solving for t, we get t = 20.
Substituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.
Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.
This is not one of the answer choices, so we need to divide it by 10 to get the answer in the given choices.
1980/10 = 198.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Let the speed of the ship = m miles/hr. and plane took 't' hours to meet the ship
Then, m×t is the distance ship traveled after plane started
So we have, mt + 180 = 10mt
⇒ 9mt = 180
⇒ mt = 20
Hence distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles

Let's find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and Y.
Amount of zinc in alloy X = (2/5) * 40 = 16 grams
Amount of copper in alloy X = (3/5) * 40 = 24 grams
Amount of zinc in alloy Y = (7/18) * 60 = 35 grams
Amount of copper in alloy Y = (11/18) * 60 = 37 grams
Total amount of zinc in alloy Z = 16 + 35 = 51 grams
Total amount of copper in alloy Z = 24 + 37 = 61 grams

Ball B takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to complete one full rotation.
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.
Action: Answer(""A"")","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
Action: 
Let's start by using the formula: distance = rate x time
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B ""t1"", and the time it took him to drive from B to A ""t2"".
We know that:
distance from A to B = distance from B to A = d
rate from A to B = 70 mph
rate from B to A = 90 mph
time from A to B = t1
time from B to A = t2
We also know that:
distance from A to B = distance from B to A = d
distance from A to B - 70 = distance from B to A + 70
Let's use these equations to solve for d:
d = 70t1
d = 90t2
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
We can use the first two equations to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d:
t1 = d/70
t2 = d/90
We can substitute these expressions for t1 and t2 into the third equation:
d - 70 = 90(d/90 - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d - 70 = d - 270

Since the left-hand side is divisible by 7, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 7.
The only value of e that satisfies this condition is 6.
Substituting e = 6 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c + 296d = 45.

The sum of the ages of n members in A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
Here, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.
So, S = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
S = n/2[15/2 + (n-1)/4]
S = n/8[2n + 13]
Given, S = 250.
So, 250 = n/8[2n + 13]
Solving the quadratic equation, we get n = 25 or -26/2.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is n = 25.
Answer: Answer(""C"")","Let, n be the number of members in the club.Then,
250 =(n x [2×7+(n+1)×3/12]) / 2.
n =25.
Hence, the number of members in the club is 25.

6 pita breads = 2 rolls
So, 1 roll = 6/2 = 3 pita breads
3 rolls = 5 baguettes
So, 1 roll = 5/3 baguettes
Therefore, 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls = 3/5 * 3 pita breads = 9/5 pita breads
2 baguettes = 2 * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads
So, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.

The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Since the numbers are odd, x must be an odd number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.
If the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.
The only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.
Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 100.
Let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Action: 
Let's start with the smallest number, 41. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, 41 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 44. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 47. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, 47 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 67. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, 67 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Let's check 91. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, 91 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.

Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is ""x steps/minute"".
From the first statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps. So, the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (20 steps)/(10 minutes) = 2 steps/minute.
From the second statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 10 steps. So, the time taken to reach the ground is 20 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (10 steps)/(20 minutes) = 0.5 steps/minute.

When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, he earns a profit.
When the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit.
Action: 
Let's solve the problem using the given information.
Profit earned when a discount of 5% is given = x * 5/100 = 0.05x
Profit earned when a discount of 7% is given = (x * 7/100) - 15
As per the question, the profit earned with a 5% discount is greater than the profit earned with a 7% discount.
So, 0.05x > (x * 7/100) - 15

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is ""x"" meters.
Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters.
We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
So, x(4x + 1) = 150
Simplifying the above equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.
Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the length and perimeter of the rectangular piece.
Action: 
Solving the quadratic equation, we get x = 5 or x = -7.5
Since the breadth cannot be negative, we will consider x = 5.
So, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 = 21 meters.
The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 meters.
Answer: Answer(""E"")","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.

Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
