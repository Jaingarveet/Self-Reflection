Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
","Choices:
  A: 2 m^3 of bricks
  B: 4 m^3 of bricks
  C: 6000 m^3 of air
  D: 10,000 m^3 of air
","Thought: 
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option using the given densities.

For 2m^3 of bricks:
Mass = Density x Volume = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg

For 4m^3 of bricks:
Mass = Density x Volume = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg

For 6000m^3 of air:
Mass = Density x Volume = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg

For 10,000m^3 of air:
Mass = Density x Volume = 1 kg/m^3 x 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg

Comparing the calculated masses, we find that 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 6000 m^3 of air.

When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?
Choices:
  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.
  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.
  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.
  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.
","Choices:
  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.
  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.
  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.
  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.
","Thought: 
When the car is on the inclined track, the force of gravity has a component that pushes the car downwards and another component that pushes the car forwards, propelling it forward. When the car reaches the flat surface, the force of gravity still acts on it, but now it only pulls the car downwards and no longer provides a force in the forward direction. This reduction in the forward force results in a decrease in the car's speed. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool.

A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
