Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$

  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The expression $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ means the fourth root of 9 cubed, or $(9^3)^{\frac{1}{4}}$.
2) $9^3 = 729$
3) So $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 729^{\frac{1}{4}}$, which is the fourth root of 729.
4) Looking at the choices, $\sqrt[4]{9}$ is the fourth root of 9, not the fourth root of 729.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Since 9 can be rewritten as $3^{2}, 9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $3^{2^{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}}$. Applying the properties of exponents, this can be written as $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$, which can further be rewritten as $3^{\frac{2}{2}}\left(3^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, an expression that is equivalent to $3 \sqrt{3}$.Choices $A$ is retry; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Choice $B$ is retry; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$. Choice $C$ is retry; it is equivalent to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$.",D,D,1,395,159,554,

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$
2) We want to find the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$
3) Let's rewrite 8 and 2 in terms of the same base:
   
   $8 = 2^3$
   
   So $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
4) From the given equation in step 1, we know that $3x - y = 12$
5) Substituting this into the expression from step 3:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. One approach is to express $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ so that the numerator and denominator are expressed with the same base. Since 2 and 8 are both powers of 2 , substituting $2^{3}$ for 8 in the numerator of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ gives $\frac{\left(2^{3}\right)^{x}}{2^{y}}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$. Since the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$ have a common base, this expression can be rewritten as $2^{3 x-y}$. It is given that $3 x-y=12$, so one can substitute 12 for the exponent, $3 x-y$, given that the expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is equal to $2^{12}$. Choice B is retry. The expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$, or $2^{3 x-y}$. If the value of $2^{3 x-y}$ is $4^{4}$, which can be rewritten as 28 , then $2^{3 x-y}=2^{8}$, which results in $3 x-y=8$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry. If the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is $8^{2}$, then $2^{3 x-y}=8^{2}$, which results in $3 x-y=6$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry because the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be determined.",A,A,1,401,247,648,

His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$

  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Alan currently drives 100 miles per week on average. His car gets 25 miles per gallon.
2) To calculate his current weekly gas cost:
   Gallons used per week = 100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons
   Cost per week = 4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16
3) Alan wants to reduce his weekly gas cost by $5. So his new weekly cost should be:
   New cost per week = $16 - $5 = $11
4) Let's say the reduced number of miles driven per week is m. We can set up an equation:
   New cost = (miles driven ÷ miles per gallon) × cost per gallon
   $11 = (m ÷ 25) × $4
5) Simplify:
   $11 = (4m ÷ 25)
   25 × $11 = 4m
   $275 = 4m
   m = $275 ÷ 4
   m = 68.75 miles
6) The equation that matches this setup is:
   (4 ÷ 25) × m = 5
   Rearranging: (4 ÷ 25)m = 5
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Since gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, and since Alan's car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon, the expression $\frac{4}{25}$ gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car.Multiplying $\frac{4}{25}$ by $m$ gives the cost for Alan to drive $m$ miles in his car. Alan wants to reduce his weekly spending by $\$ 5$, so setting $\frac{4}{25} m$ equal to 5 gives the number of miles, $m$, by which he must reduce his driving.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are retry. Choices $A$ and $B$ transpose the numerator and the denominator in the fraction. The fraction $\frac{25}{4}$ would result in the unit miles per dollar, but the question requires a unit of dollars per mile. Choices $A$ and $C$ set the expression equal to 95 instead of 5, a mistake that may result from a misconception that Alan wants to reduce his driving by 5 miles each week; instead, the question says he wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\$ 5$.",D,D,1,481,354,835,
