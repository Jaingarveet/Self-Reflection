A: If Franco is the only witness on Monday, this satisfies constraints 1, 4 and 5. It's possible.
B: If Franco testifies on Wednesday with Iturbe, this satisfies constraint 1. It's possible. 
C: If Garcia and Hong both testify Tuesday, this satisfies constraints 1, 3 and 4. It's possible.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint is that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least 3 spaces between the restaurants.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) If a restaurant must be in space 3, 4, or 5, this would put the restaurants next to each other or only 1 space apart. This is not equivalent to the original constraint. 
B) The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, not a restaurant. This contradicts the given constraints.
C) If the toy store or veterinarian is between the restaurants, that would mean the restaurants are separated by only 1 business. This is not the same as being separated by at least 2 businesses.
D) If no more than 2 businesses separate the pharmacy and nearest restaurant, the restaurants could still be only 1 business apart (if the pharmacy is at one end and a restaurant is 2 spaces away). This allows arrangements prohibited by the original constraint.
E) The location of the optometrist and shoe store is not directly relevant to the separation of the restaurants. Prohibiting them from being adjacent does not have the same effect as requiring the restaurants to have at least 2 businesses between them.
After analyzing each choice, none of them have the exact same effect as the original constraint about the separation of the restaurants.

  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This satisfies the constraint that Robertson must be assigned space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
2. Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa. And Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. 
   So the order from lowest to highest must be: Togowa, Young, Robertson
   Since Robertson is in space #3, Young must be in #1 or #2, and Togowa must be in #1 (if Young is in #2) or #2 (if Young is in #1).
3. Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza.
   The remaining higher-numbered spaces are #4, #5 and #6. 
   So Souza must be in #4 or #5, and Xu must be in #5 (if Souza is in #4) or #6 (if Souza is in #5).
4. For the answers given:
   A: Souza could be assigned #4, but doesn't have to be. It depends on where Xu is.

  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian reviews the most plays.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the plays Jiang reviews are different from those reviewed by Lopez and Megregian. 
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they review at least one play in common.
4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s) as each other. Given #3, this must be Kramer and O'Neill. No other pair can review the exact same set of plays.
5. Since Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian (#1), and Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays (#4), O'Neill must also review fewer plays than Megregian.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. 
2. Jackson is the only one testifying on Monday, so that leaves Franco, Garcia and Hong to testify on Tuesday and Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Since Iturbe is on Wednesday, that means the other Wednesday slot must be filled by either Franco, Garcia or Hong.
4. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. So if one is on Tuesday, the other must be on Wednesday. 
5. Hong does not testify on Monday, so he must testify on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
Let's consider the possibilities:
- If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday (along with Iturbe). That would leave Hong to testify on Tuesday. 
- If Garcia testifies on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Wednesday (along with Iturbe). Again, Hong would testify on Tuesday.
- If Hong testifies on Wednesday, then both Franco and Garcia would have to testify on Tuesday. But that's not possible since they can't testify on the same day.
Therefore, the only possible scenarios are:
- Monday: Jackson, Tuesday: Franco & Hong, Wednesday: Garcia & Iturbe
- Monday: Jackson, Tuesday: Garcia & Hong, Wednesday: Franco & Iturbe

2. Since there must be at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, R must be performed either second or eighth. 
3. O must be performed either first or fifth, but since T is fifth, O must be first.
4. The eighth composition is either L or H. Since R can't be eighth (because there needs to be two compositions between F and R), the eighth must be L or H.
5. P must be performed before S. And there must be at least one composition either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
6. If R is second, then the order so far is: O _ R _ T F _ _

- From 3, the breed on day 1 (Greyhound) can't be on day 7. From 5, Rottweilers can't be on day 7. And from 6, Himalayans aren't on day 7.

1. Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports. This means the other five students (George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, Robert) must give the three afternoon reports.
2. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must give the Tuesday afternoon report. 
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So the Monday and Wednesday afternoon reports must be given by either Irving or Nina.
4. If Nina gives a report, then the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
   - Nina can't report Monday (because then Helen and Irving would have to report Tuesday, but George must report Tuesday afternoon)
   - Nina can't report Tuesday (because then Helen and Irving would have to report Wednesday, but they are giving morning reports)
   - So Nina must report Wednesday afternoon, if at all
5. This leaves Irving to give the Monday afternoon report.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the scheduling conditions and restrictions:
1. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must report on Tuesday, either morning or afternoon.
2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they report, it must be in the morning. 
3. If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
4. Kyle and Lenore are not reporting.
5. There must be exactly 2 reports per day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.
Let's start filling in the schedule, being mindful of the restrictions:
- Tuesday morning must be George. That's the only slot he can take.
- Monday morning could be Olivia or Robert since they can only do mornings. Let's tentatively put Robert on Monday morning.
- If Nina reports Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must report on a non-existent Thursday. So Nina cannot report Wednesday. She must report Monday or Tuesday.
- If Nina reports Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must report Tuesday. But George has to report Tuesday. So Nina cannot report Monday. 
- Nina must report Tuesday afternoon. That puts Helen and Irving on Wednesday.
Checking the final schedule:
Monday morning: Robert
Monday afternoon: [someone]
Tuesday morning: George 
Tuesday afternoon: Nina
Wednesday morning: Helen
Wednesday afternoon: Irving
This matches choice E: Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question states that both G and H are selected. Since G and H are both botanists, this means the panel includes more than one botanist.
2. One of the conditions states: ""If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected."" 
   So with G and H on the panel, there can be at most one zoologist.
3. Another condition states: ""If M is selected, both P and R must be selected."" 
   But P and R are both zoologists. If they were both selected, that would violate the condition from step 2 (at most one zoologist if more than one botanist).
   
4. Therefore, chemist M cannot be selected, because that would force the selection of both P and R, which is not allowed in this scenario.
5. So one of the chemists K or L must be selected instead to satisfy the condition of having at least one of each type of scientist.

2. Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. Since Helen is already giving the Wednesday afternoon report, Nina cannot report on Tuesday. 
4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Since the Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon slots are filled by Kyle and Helen respectively, Olivia and Robert are only eligible for morning reports.
5. Looking at the answer choices, only B and D have George giving the Tuesday morning report, so A, C and E can be eliminated.
6. Between B and D, only B has a valid combination for the Monday morning report - Lenore. If Robert gave the Monday morning report as in D, then Olivia would have to give the Wednesday morning report (since Nina reporting on Monday or Tuesday would require both Helen and Irving to report the following day).

The original constraint is: If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
Looking at each answer choice:
A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo. 
This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In general, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. So this would have the same effect as the original constraint.
B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.
This introduces a new condition not present in the original constraint. It would add a new restriction rather than having the same effect.
C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. 
This also introduces Ong, who was not part of the original constraint. It would change the meaning.
D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
The original constraint doesn't say anything about Jaramillo and Novetzke not being able to both be assigned. This changes the meaning.
E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
Again, the original constraint doesn't mention Novetzke and Ong. This would be a new restriction.

B) J is 1st - This is possible. If J is 1st, then an arrangement like J-Q-S-G-Y-H-R would satisfy all conditions. Keep as a possibility.
C) Q is 2nd - This is not possible. If Q (nutrition) is 2nd, then S (also nutrition) would have to be 1st to be earlier than Q. But J (finance) must be earlier than G which is 4th, so J must occupy one of the first 3 spots. Eliminated.
D) S is 5th - This is possible. If S is 5th, then an arrangement like J-Y-H-G-S-Q-R would satisfy all conditions. Keep as a possibility.
E) Y is 6th - This is not possible. S (nutrition) must be earlier than Y (wildlife). If Y is 6th, S would have to be 5th. But G (finance) is 4th, so R (nutrition) must be later, leaving no spot for S before Y. Eliminated.

1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This is a fixed condition.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. The third solo is traditional, so either the 2nd and 3rd, or the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces. 
3. In the 4th solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces, then Wayne must perform the 4th solo (since the 2nd and 5th solos can't be by the same pianist).
4. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the 1st or 2nd solo.
Considering these conditions, here is a scenario that minimizes the number of traditional pieces performed by Wayne:
1st solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
2nd solo: Zara performs a modern piece 
3rd solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
4th solo: Zara performs a traditional piece

5. The fourth condition states K and M cannot both be selected. This eliminates M as a possibility for the fifth scientist, as K could still be selected. So answer choice D is incorrect.
6. The fifth condition states if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. This condition is satisfied vacuously as M is not selected. It does not force the selection of P.

4. O is on a higher shelf than L. 
5. The key condition: L is on a higher shelf than H. 
   This means the order from top to bottom is: K, O, L, H (not necessarily next to each other).
6. Since I is on the middle shelf, and K is on the top shelf, O must also be on the top shelf with K.
7. L and H must be on the bottom shelf, since L is above H but below O.
8. F and M must be on the middle shelf with I, since they can't be with K on top or with L and H on bottom.

  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the advice from the self-reflection:
1. The key information is that Theresa tests bicycle J on the first day. Let's consider the implications of this, along with the other given conditions.
2. Since Yuki cannot test J, and Theresa is testing J on day 1, Yuki must test either F, G or H on day 1. 
3. Whichever bicycle Yuki tests on day 1 must be tested by Seamus on day 2. This means Seamus cannot test J on either day, eliminating choice D.
4. Since Reynaldo cannot test F, he must test either G or H on day 1. 
5. Theresa must test H on one of the days. Since she's testing J on day 1, she must test H on day 2. This eliminates choice E, as Theresa cannot test G on either day.
6. The only remaining choice that is not yet eliminated is A. Let's check if it's possible for Reynaldo to test G on day 2:
   Day 1: Theresa-J, Yuki-H, Seamus-F, Reynaldo-G
   Day 2: Theresa-H, Seamus-H, Reynaldo-G, Yuki-F
   This scenario satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, choice A could be true.

  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know there are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. 
2. Each shelf must have at least 2 books, and there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top.
3. I is on the middle shelf.
4. K is on a higher shelf than F. 
5. O is on a higher shelf than L.
6. F and M are on the same shelf.
7. The question states that G is on the top shelf.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A. H, I 
This is possible. I is given to be on the middle shelf. H could also be on the middle shelf with I, leaving room for the other books on the top and bottom shelves.
B. I, L
This is not possible. If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf (since O is higher than L). But we are told G is on the top shelf. There isn't room for both O and G on the top shelf along with the 2 minimum books on the bottom shelf.
C. H, I, L 
This has the same issue as B. If L is on the middle, O must be on the top. But G is already on the top.
D. I, K, L
Again, if L is in the middle, then O must be on top with G. But K must also be on top (above F). There isn't room for G, O and K on the top shelf.
E. F, I, M
We're told F and M are on the same shelf. But K must be on a higher shelf than F and M. If F and M are in the middle with I, then K must be on top. But G is on top. There's no configuration that allows F, I, M in the middle.
Therefore, after carefully considering each choice, A is the only possible correct answer.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering each constraint:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. 
2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5. The shoe store is given to be in space 2.
With the shoe store in space 2, the pharmacy must be in space 1 to satisfy constraint 1. This eliminates choice A.
If the pharmacy is in space 1, then by constraint 3, either the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. But space 2 is occupied by the shoe store. So the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 3.
By constraint 4, if the veterinarian is in space 3, then the toy store cannot be in space 4. 
But if the optometrist is in space 3, the toy store could be in space 4, 5 or 6 without violating any constraints.
So choice D, ""The toy store is in space 6"", is a possibility that does not violate any constraints.
The other choices can be eliminated:
B is false because the pharmacy must be in space 1, not 7, if the shoe store is in space 2.
C is false because space 3 must be the optometrist or veterinarian, not a restaurant.
E is false because the veterinarian cannot be next to the toy store.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The key information is that Theresa tests bicycle G on the second day. Let's consider what that means for the other riders and bicycles.
2. We know Theresa must test bicycle H on one of the days. Since she tests G on the second day, she must test H on the first day.
3. Yuki cannot test bicycle J at all. And the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
4. If Yuki tested bicycle H on the first day, then Seamus would have to test it on the second day. But we know Theresa tests H on the first day, so this is not possible.
5. If Yuki tested bicycle G on the first day, then Seamus would have to test it on the second day. But we know Theresa tests G on the second day, so this is also not possible.
6. Therefore, Yuki must test bicycle F on the first day, and Seamus will test F on the second day.
7. By process of elimination, Reynaldo must test bicycle J on the first day, since it's the only one left.
So in summary:
First day: Theresa-H, Yuki-F, Reynaldo-J, Seamus-G
Second day: Theresa-G, Seamus-F, Reynaldo-H, Yuki-J
Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.

  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Y (wildlife) is fourth. 
2. S (nutrition) must come before Y. So S must be 1st, 2nd or 3rd.
3. Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic. So if S is 3rd, Q or R must be 1st or 2nd. But Q can only be 3rd if it comes after S. Therefore, S cannot be 3rd.
4. So S must be 1st or 2nd. If S is 1st, then a finance article (G, H or J) must be 2nd. If S is 2nd, then a finance article must be 1st.
5. We know J (finance) must be earlier than G (finance). And G must be earlier than R (nutrition). 
6. If a finance article is 1st, it must be J. Then S would be 2nd, Y 4th, and G 5th or later. R would have to be 6th or 7th.
7. If S is 1st, J would be 2nd, then a non-finance 3rd (Q or R), then Y 4th, G 5th or later, and R 6th or 7th.
In both possible scenarios, R must be either 6th or 7th. Therefore, the correct answer is that R must be seventh.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1. This means they can't be featured on day 7.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1. So they must be on 3 of days 2-7. 
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on any day with Himalayans or on day 7.
4. No breed can be featured on consecutive days.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A. Greyhounds on days 3 and 5 would violate the no consecutive days rule. Eliminate A.
B. Newfoundlands on day 3 is possible. Keep B.
C. If Himalayans aren't on day 7, they could be on days 2, 4, 6. Then Rottweilers could be on day 3 or 5. So day 6 is possible for Rottweilers. Keep C.
D. Similar to C, Rottweilers only on day 3 is possible if Himalayans are on 2, 4, 6. Keep D.
E. Rottweilers can't be on 3 days, as that would require them being on a Himalayan day or day 7. Eliminate E.
Of the remaining B, C, D, I believe D is the strongest answer. It's very plausible Rottweilers would only be featured once on day 3, with Himalayans on 2, 4, 6. While B and C are possible, they aren't as likely or definitive scenarios.

4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.

   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target
2. We're told Image's website target is 2 days. 
3. Since no website target can be longer than the voicemail target, Image's voicemail target must be either 2 days or 1 day to satisfy this condition.
4. But Image's voicemail target also has to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
5. So Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days, because then it would not be possible for it to be shorter than both Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets (as they can only be 1, 2 or 3 days).

2. If more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, and more work in Zone 3 than Zone 2, then Zone 1 has the most reps. Let's say Zone 1 has 4 reps.
3. That leaves 3 reps split between Zones 2 and 3. Since Zone 3 has more than Zone 2, Zone 3 must have 2 reps and Zone 2 has 1 rep.
4. Parra and Tiao can't both be in Zone 1. Let's put Parra in Zone 1. Then Tiao must be in Zone 2.

2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So textiles must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4, and livestock must be in 2, 3, 4, or 5. 
3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So produce must be in 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and fuel must be in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Given the ranges determined above, this means textiles must be in 3 or 4, and produce must be in 4 or 5.

4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

- The eighth composition is L or H (condition 4).
- T must be next to either F or R (condition 1).

Considering all this, P cannot be seventh because:
- If P is seventh, S must be eighth.

P also cannot be sixth, because:

  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering each constraint and answer choice:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne.
3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned, it is to Zambia.
Now let's test each answer choice:
A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
This is possible. If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned (constraint 2). Kayne could be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen, satisfying constraint 1. This doesn't violate any other constraints.
B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
This is possible. Landon could be unassigned, Jaramillo to Venezuela or Yemen, and Novetzke and Ong assigned to the remaining countries. This satisfies all constraints.
C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
This is possible. Kayne could be unassigned per constraint 1. Jaramillo, Landon and Ong could be assigned in ways that satisfy the other constraints.
D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
This is possible and doesn't violate constraint 4, which only applies if Landon is assigned. The other ambassadors can be assigned in ways that meet the constraints.
E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
This CANNOT be true. If Ong is unassigned, the remaining 4 ambassadors must be assigned to the 3 countries. But constraint 1 says Kayne and Novetzke can't both be assigned. So there aren't enough ambassadors if Ong is unassigned.
Therefore, E is the correct answer.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This is given in the question.
2. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned. Since Kayne is assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
3. If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne. The contrapositive is also true: if Kayne is assigned (which he is), then Jaramillo must also be assigned. So Jaramillo gets one of the other two posts (Venezuela or Zambia).
4. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. But Kayne is assigned to Yemen. Therefore, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela. 
5. If Landon is assigned, it is to Zambia. But if Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia (one of his two possible posts), then Landon cannot be. The only way Landon can be assigned is if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela.
Putting it all together:
- Kayne is assigned to Yemen
- Jaramillo must be assigned, either to Venezuela or Zambia
- If Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Landon is assigned to Zambia
- If Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia, then Ong is assigned to Venezuela
Either way, Jaramillo must be assigned. Therefore, the answer that must be true is:

3. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. 
4. We're told Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone. Let's consider the possibilities:
Possibility 1: Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1
- This would mean Parra and Quinn are also in Zone 1 (4 reps)
- Udall must be in Zone 2 with Tiao
- Kim is the only rep left for Zone 3
This violates the condition of more reps in Zone 3 than 2. So this is impossible.
Possibility 2: Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2 
- Udall is also in Zone 2 (3 reps)
- Tiao must be in Zone 1 with either Parra or Quinn
- The other of Parra/Quinn plus Kim are in Zone 3 (2 reps)
This is consistent with all the conditions. Under this scenario, Tiao works in Zone 1.

4. J must be before G, which must be before R.

A) If H is 4th, that doesn't fully determine the order. H could be followed by any of Q, R, S or Y and still meet the constraints. Eliminated.
B) If H is 6th, then the finance articles must be in slots 1, 3, 6 to avoid being consecutive. That means J, G, H in that order. The other slots would have to be Q, R, S, Y in some order, with S before Y. But their exact positions aren't fixed. Eliminated.
C) If R is 4th, then J and G must be 1st and 3rd to be before R. H would be 6th. That leaves slots 2, 5, 7 for Q, S, Y. S must be before Y. The only way to fit that is S 2nd, Q 5th, Y 7th. So this fully determines the order: J, S, G, R, Q, H, Y. Looks promising.
D) If R is 7th, J and G could be in slots 1, 3, 4 or 6 and still be before R. Doesn't fully determine it. Eliminated.

2. S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.
3. S must be earlier than Y.
4. J must be earlier than G, which must be earlier than R.
5. We're told J is third.
From constraint 4, since J is third, G must be 4th or later, and R must be 5th or later. This eliminates choice A (G is fourth).
Y (the wildlife article) must be after S per constraint 3. The only spot left for Y is 7th, as the other spots are taken by finance and nutrition articles. This eliminates choice E (Y is fifth).
Q and R have to be separated by a finance article per constraint 1. The only way to do this with R 5th or later is for H to be 6th. R is then 7th. 
So far the order is:
1. ?
2. S (nutrition) 
3. J (finance)
4. ?
5. ?
6. H (finance) 
7. R (nutrition)
Q can't be 1st because then S would be before it (violating constraint 2). So Q is 4th or 5th.
If Q is 4th, then G is 5th. But if Q is 5th, then G could be 1st or 4th.
So G could be 1st, eliminating choice B (H is sixth). And Q could be 1st, so choice C is possible.

5. P is performed at some time before S. 
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
We're also told that P is 3rd and S is 6th. 
From condition 3, since P is 3rd, O must be 5th (it can only be 1st or 5th).
Condition 6 is satisfied since there is one composition (P) after O and before S.
Condition 5 is satisfied since P (3rd) is before S (6th).
Condition 4 means either L or H is 8th. This leaves the other one to be either 2nd, 4th or 7th.

- 3 sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3

- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone

Let's consider each answer choice:
A: Kim, Mahr
This doesn't contradict any conditions. But it may not be a complete list for Zone 3, as the question asks. Not enough info to confirm or deny.
B: Kim, Tiao
If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Parra must be in Zone 1 (first condition), and Udall must be in Zone 2 (second condition). This forces Stuckey to also be in Zone 2 (fourth condition). So Zone 2 would have Stuckey and Udall, same as Zone 3, violating the last condition. Contradiction, so B is incorrect.
C: Parra, Quinn
They must be in the same zone per the third condition. But this list may not be complete for Zone 3. Not enough info to confirm or deny. 
D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone per fourth condition. If they're in Zone 3 with Tiao, then Parra must be in Zone 1 (first condition), leaving Quinn also in Zone 1 (third condition). This leaves only Mahr and Kim for Zone 2, satisfying the last condition. So this is a possible complete list for Zone 3.

Parra and Quinn together (third condition), and Stuckey and Udall together (fourth condition), in Zone 3 satisfy all conditions and make this the largest possible Zone 3. This could be a complete list for Zone 3.

   - Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other.

3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they could be the two who review the same plays. 
4. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can (given fact #2). But then Kramer and O'Neill would have to review Undulation to make three total. However, this would mean more than two students review the same plays, violating fact #4. So Jiang cannot review Undulation.

  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.
  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering the most restrictive constraints first:
1. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This eliminates her from the two morning slots Julio and Kevin are assigned to.
2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since Kevin has a morning session, Rebecca must have the afternoon session that same day. 
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
4. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. 
This would mean Olivia has to lead the Thursday or Friday session. That works, so this could be true.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.
If Lan is Thursday afternoon, Olivia has to be Wednesday or Friday. Julio is in the morning before Olivia, so Julio, Kevin and Rebecca fill the Wednesday or Friday slots. This schedule works without violating constraints, so this could be true.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. 
Nessa must be in the afternoon. If she's Friday afternoon, Julio and Kevin are Wednesday or Thursday morning. Rebecca is the same day afternoon as Kevin. Lan and Olivia fill the remaining slots without being on the same day. This works, so it could be true.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.
If Olivia is Thursday morning, Julio must be Wednesday morning to be earlier. But Kevin is also in a morning slot and must be the same day as Rebecca. That only leaves Friday for Kevin, Rebecca and Lan. But Rebecca needs to be in the afternoon, and Nessa has the only afternoon slot. This violates the constraints, so this CANNOT be true.
E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.
With Olivia on Friday, Julio must be Wednesday or Thursday morning. Kevin gets the other morning, with Rebecca that same afternoon. Lan and Nessa get the remaining slots without conflict. So this could be true.

2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf.
3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
4. I is on the middle shelf.
5. K is on a higher shelf than F.
6. O is on a higher shelf than L.
7. F is on the same shelf as M.
From conditions 5 and 7, we know F and M must be together on either the middle or bottom shelf (since K is higher than F).
From condition 4, I is on the middle shelf. So F and M cannot be on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
Condition 3 says there are more books on the bottom than the top. With F and M already on the bottom, there must be at least 3 books there to have more than the top (which has at least 2). 
Looking at the answer choices, only B and D have F and M on the bottom shelf with at least 3 books total. 
Between B and D, only D has more than 3 books on the bottom, satisfying the condition of having more books on the bottom than the top.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the advice and constraints:
1. S covers nutrition, along with Q and R. Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic, so S can't be directly before or after Q or R.
2. S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. This means if S is first, Q must be third. 
3. S must be earlier than Y. Since Y is the only wildlife article, this doesn't directly constrain S's position, but it does mean S can't be seventh.
4. J, G, and R cover finance in that order. They must have at least one article between each of them. 
5. Let's consider each answer choice:
   A. S first: This works. We could have S, Y, Q, J, G, R, H for example. Not eliminated.
   
   B. S third: This violates the condition that S can only be before Q if Q is third. Eliminated.
   
   C. S fourth: This works. We could have Y, J, G, S, Q, R, H for example. Not eliminated.
   
   D. S fifth: This also works. We could have Y, J, Q, G, S, R, H. Not eliminated.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step, applying the constraints one at a time:
1. Bay 4 is holding produce. This definitively determines bay 4's cargo.
2. Textiles must be next to produce. Since produce is in bay 4, textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. This narrows it down but doesn't definitively determine the location of textiles yet.
3. Livestock has a lower number than grain. This tells us livestock and grain can't be in bays 5 or 6, as one of those must be textiles. But it doesn't definitively place livestock or grain.
4. Livestock has a higher number than textiles. Since textiles is in bay 3 or 5, this means livestock must be in whichever one of those textiles isn't in. So if textiles is in 3, livestock is in 5, and vice versa. This definitively determines the locations of both textiles and livestock.
5. Produce has a higher number than fuel. We know produce is in bay 4, so fuel must be in bay 1, 2, or 3. The only one of those not already determined is bay 2, so fuel must be in bay 2. This definitively determines the location of fuel.
6. The only two cargos left are machinery and grain. We determined above that grain must be in bay 5 or 6. The only one of those not definitively determined to be holding something else is bay 6, so grain must be in bay 6 and machinery must be in bay 1 by process of elimination. This definitively determines the locations of the final two cargos.
In summary, the locations definitively determined are:
Bay 1: Machinery 
Bay 2: Fuel
Bay 3: Textiles
Bay 4: Produce
Bay 5: Livestock
Bay 6: Grain
Therefore, the type of cargo is completely determined for all six bays.

1. The organizer must select at least 5 works total. 
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. This means at least 1 Russian work must be selected.
3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. If only 3 novels are selected, both plays must be selected to reach the minimum of 5 works total.
4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. This means the number of French novels is ≥ the number of Russian novels.
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) One French novel and one French play are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and the Russian play are chosen.
B) The Russian play is not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen. 
C) One Russian novel and one French play are not necessarily selected together, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen.
D) Two French novels must be selected. If only 1 French novel was selected, then 0 Russian novels could be selected (violating constraint 4), meaning ≤2 novels total (violating constraint 3).
E) Two Russian novels are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and 1 French play are chosen.

  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The given information is:
- 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) on 3 shelves 
- At least 2 books per shelf
- More books on bottom shelf than top shelf
- I is on the middle shelf
- K is on a higher shelf than F
- O is on a higher shelf than L
- F and M are on the same shelf
Since I is on the middle shelf, that leaves 7 books to arrange on the top and bottom shelves. 
More books must be on the bottom than top. So the only possible arrangements are:
2 books on top, 5 on bottom
3 books on top, 4 on bottom
F and M must be together. K must be higher than F. O must be higher than L.
Let's consider each choice:
A) If I and M are on the same (middle) shelf, then F is also middle. But then we can't determine if K and O are top or bottom. Eliminates A.
B) If K and G are on the same shelf, they could be either top or middle (above F). Can't fully determine. Eliminates B.
C) If L and F are on the same (bottom) shelf, then M is also bottom. K and O must be higher, so middle or top. Still can't fully determine. Eliminates C.
D) If M and H are on the same shelf as F (bottom), then L is also bottom. That's 5 books bottom. O and K must be middle and top in some order, with G on the remaining shelf. This fully determines the arrangement! 
E) If H and O are on the same shelf, they could be either middle or top. Can't fully determine. Eliminates E.

  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday (since no two batches of the same cookie are made on the same day).
2. We're told at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. And if exactly one batch is made on Friday, that means 4 batches are made across Mon-Thurs. 
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. So those two batches will take up one of the Mon-Thurs slots.
4. Now let's look at each answer choice:
A) If the first sugar batch is Monday, that would force the third sugar batch to be Tues or Wed. But then there's no room for the 2nd oatmeal and 1st PB batches. So A is not possible.
B) The first oatmeal batch could be Tuesday. This is still possible so far.
C) If the 3rd oatmeal batch is Friday, then the 1st and 2nd oatmeal batches, plus the 1st PB batch, must be Mon-Thurs. This could work with the sugar cookie constraints. So C is possible.
D) If 1st PB is Wed, then 2nd oatmeal is also Wed. 1st and 3rd sugar must be Mon & Tues in some order. That leaves Thurs for either 1st or 3rd oatmeal only. So D doesn't work.
E) 2nd PB on Tues is possible. 1st PB and 2nd oatmeal could be Mon, leaving Wed for either 1st or 3rd sugar. So E is still possible.

Now let's evaluate each answer choice:
A. L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
   - Violates condition 1 (T is not immediately before F or after R)
   - Violates condition 3 (O is not first or fifth)
B. O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L
   - Satisfies condition 1 (T is immediately before F)
   - Satisfies condition 2 (P and S are between F and R)
   - Satisfies condition 3 (O is first)
   - Satisfies condition 4 (L is eighth)
   - Satisfies condition 5 (P is before S)
   - Satisfies condition 6 (T, P, F are between O and S)
   This choice satisfies all conditions.
C. P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H
   - Violates condition 3 (O is not first or fifth)
   - Violates condition 4 (H is not eighth)
D. P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H
   - Violates condition 1 (T is not immediately before F or after R)
   - Violates condition 4 (H is not eighth)
E. T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H
   - Violates condition 2 (only P is between F and R, need at least two)
   - Violates condition 5 (P is not before S)
The only choice that satisfies all the conditions is B.
