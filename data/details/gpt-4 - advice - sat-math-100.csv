A line passes through the origin if its equation is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Here, the points are (2, k) and (k, 32). So, the slope is (32 - k) / (k - 2). This slope should be equal to the slope of the line passing through the origin, which is k/2. So, we have the equation (32 - k) / (k - 2) = k/2.
Solving this equation for k, we get k = 4.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$.

","Thought: 
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, the difference in y-values between the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a) is -a - 0 = -a. The difference in x-values is 3a - a = 2a. So, the slope m = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0. From the table, we can see that the y-intercept is not given. However, we can use the point (a, 0) and the slope to find the y-intercept. If we plug these values into the equation y = mx + b, we get 0 = -1/2*a + b. Solving for b gives b = a/2.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2*x + a/2. Multiplying through by 2 to get rid of the fractions gives 2y = -x + a. Rearranging terms gives x + 2y = a.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$.

To find the x-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can do this by using the method of elimination or substitution. 
First, we can multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:
1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15
2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95

The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites. Adding the left- and right-hand sides of the equations $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ produces $7.2 x+0.0 y=-3.6$, which is equivalent to $7.2 x=-3.6$.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.
