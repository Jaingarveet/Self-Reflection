  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","  Answer: ""C""

Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants. This constraint has the same effect as the original constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. It ensures that there is at least one business between the two restaurants and, therefore, the two restaurants cannot be adjacent to each other.

Here's how the businesses could be arranged to satisfy all the constraints:

Space 1: Pharmacy
Space 2: Optometrist
Space 3: Restaurant 1
Space 4: Toy Store
Space 5: Restaurant 2
Space 6: Veterinarian
Space 7: Shoe Store

In this arrangement, the pharmacy is at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants (Restaurant 1) is at the other end. The two restaurants are separated by three other businesses (Optometrist, Toy Store, and Veterinarian). The pharmacy is next to the optometrist, and the toy store is not next to the veterinarian.

","  Thought: 
The given information can be summarized as follows:
* F is on the same shelf as M.
* I is on the middle shelf.
* K is on a higher shelf than F.
* O is on a higher shelf than L.

From the conditions, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the top shelf must have at most two books.

We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf.

Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, we can analyze the choices:

A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.
This is false. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and O is on a higher shelf than F, O must be on a higher shelf than M.

B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.
This is true. We know that K is on the top shelf, and G is not on the top shelf, so this condition must be true.

C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.
This is false. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F is on the middle shelf, this condition must be false.

D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.
This is false. We know that G is not on the top shelf, and O is on the top shelf, so this condition must be false.

E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.

1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

From condition 1, we can conclude that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
From condition 2, we know that Jiang reviews a play that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews.
From condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
From condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.

Now, let's consider each choice:

A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.
This is false. We know that Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez, and Jiang may review the same number of plays as Lopez or fewer plays than Megregian.

B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
This is true. We know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and Jiang may review fewer plays than Megregian.

C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.
This is false. We know that O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, and Megregian may review fewer plays than O'Neill.

D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
This is false. We know that Jiang may review the same number of plays as O'Neill or fewer plays than Megregian.

E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.

The question asks us to determine which of the given options could be all of the traditional pieces performed during the recital. We must analyze the conditions given in the question and use a process of elimination to arrive at the answer.

2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.

From condition 1, we know that the third solo is traditional. Let's call it T3.

From condition 2, we know that two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. So, either the second solo is traditional (T2) and the third solo is traditional (T3), or the fourth solo is traditional (T4) and the fifth solo is traditional (T5).

From condition 3, we know that either Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo or Zara performs a modern piece. If Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, then it must be T4. If Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, then the fifth solo must be traditional (T5).

From condition 4, we know that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. So, if T2 is performed in the second solo, then the fifth solo cannot be traditional (T5).

From condition 5, we know that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that if T2 is performed in the second solo, then Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first solo (M1). If T3 is performed in the third solo, then Wayne must perform a modern piece in the fourth solo (M4).

Now, let's analyze the options:

A: The first, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 2, as only two traditional pieces are performed consecutively.

B: The second, third, and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 4, as the pianist who performs the second solo (Wayne) performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo.

C: The third and fourth solos are traditional pieces. This option satisfies all the conditions, as the third solo is traditional (T3), and either the fourth solo is traditional (T4) or the fifth solo is traditional (T5).

D: The third and fifth solos are traditional pieces. This option violates condition 5, as no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.

","  Answer: B

Explanation:
This question is a classic example of a ""scheduling problem"" often encountered in logic and law. We can use a methodical approach to determine the correct answer.

From the given conditions, we know that:

* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

Let's analyze each choice:

A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
This schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
This schedule meets all the given conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday morning, and Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively, which satisfies the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is correct.

C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
This schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
This schedule violates the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George
This schedule violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

A: Helen gives a report on Monday.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, Helen cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B: Irving gives a report on Monday.
As mentioned above, George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday. Hence, this option is incorrect.

C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.
This option is possible. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is correct.

D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

","  Answer: C

If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. This is the same effect as the original constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.

Explanation:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of those countries.

Option C states that if Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. This means that if Ong is not assigned to Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned to one of those countries. This has the same effect as the original constraint, as it ensures that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

The other options do not have the same effect as the original constraint:

Option A states that if Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo. This is not the same as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

Option B states that if Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke. This has no relation to the original constraint.

Option D states that Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships. This is not the same as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

Explanation:
The conditions provide a lot of information, but they do not specify the order of the solos. Let's consider the possibilities:

1. Wayne performs a modern piece first, followed by Zara performing a traditional piece. In this case, the third solo must be a traditional piece, and the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara. This means Wayne will not perform a traditional piece in the first four solos.
2. Zara performs a modern piece first, followed by Wayne performing a traditional piece. In this case, the third solo must be a traditional piece, and the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne. This means Wayne will perform a traditional piece in the third solo.

In either case, Wayne will perform a traditional piece at most in the third solo. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is three.

1. The first and second solos are performed by the same pianist.
2. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, and no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo.
3. Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece.
4. Since exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must be a traditional piece.

Also, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be 2 days. Image's website target cannot be 1 day since it's longer than Solide's website target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days.

Given these conditions, the only option that cannot be true is E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day since it's shorter than its website target (2 days). Therefore, option E is the correct answer.",,,B,0,538,207,745,

","  Thought: 
If P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist. Let's consider the possible combinations:

1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. But this violates the condition that if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. Therefore, this combination is not possible.
2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. But this violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this combination is not possible.
3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. This satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the only possible combination that satisfies all the conditions is H-L-M-P.

* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so it's made on Tuesday.
* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
* The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

Since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, they must be featured on one of the first six days. They cannot be featured on day 2 because Himalayans are featured on that day, and they cannot be featured on day 6 because they are not featured on day 7.

Assuming more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, we can start by analyzing the given conditions:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

From condition 1, we know that if Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Similarly, if Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1.

From condition 2, we know that if Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Similarly, if Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.

From condition 3, we know that Parra and Quinn work together in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.

From condition 4, we know that Stuckey and Udall work together in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.

Now, let's consider the options:

A: Kim works in Zone 2.
This is possible, but it doesn't help us determine the truth of any other statement.

B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
This is also possible, but like option A, it doesn't help us determine the truth of any other statement.

C: Parra works in Zone 3.
If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1 (due to condition 1). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.

D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1 (due to condition 1). This means Parra must work in Zone 3, and Quinn must work in Zone 2 (due to condition 3). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.

E: Udall works in Zone 3.
If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must work in Zone 2 (due to condition 4). But this contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, this option is false.

Given that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, we can infer that the three batches of cookies made on Monday, Thursday, and Friday will be different kinds of cookies.

We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on Tuesday.

We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, the second batch will be made on Thursday, leaving Tuesday and Friday for the remaining batches.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

This is a classic logic puzzle. Let's break it down step by step.
We know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This means that two students will give reports each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. So, if George gives a report, it must be on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that if Olivia gives a report, it must be in the morning, and if Robert gives a report, it must be in the afternoon.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
Now, let's consider the given options:
Option A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
As discussed above, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
This option is correct. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George must give a report on Tuesday as well, since Tuesday is the only day he can give a report. Therefore, Nina and George can give reports on different days from each other.

Option D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
As discussed above, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, if Olivia gives a report on Monday, it must be in the morning. However, this means that Robert cannot give a report on Monday, since he must give a report in the afternoon. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

This choice satisfies all the conditions. Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1. Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work together in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work together in Zone 2. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn

The question provides specific conditions for the order in which the articles are edited. We can create a diagram to help us visualize the conditions:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so we can start by placing the finance articles together:

G - H - J

We also know that S must be earlier than Y, so we can place Y in the last position:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

Now, we need to determine where S can be placed. We know that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, we can place Q in the third position:

G - H - J
Q
R - S
Y

However, this order violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, we must reverse the order of the finance articles:

H - G - J
Q
R - S
Y

Now, we can place S in the fourth position:

H - G - J

S
Y

Therefore, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:

From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:

* The top shelf has 2 books, the middle shelf has 3 books, and the bottom shelf has 3 books.
* I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
* K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.

A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
This choice does not provide any new information and does not help determine the shelves for all the books.

The question states that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, we can conclude that each day of the week is used to make a batch of a different kind of cookie.

The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a day before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.

The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies is made on a day before Thursday.

The number of batches made on Friday is exactly one. Therefore, the third batch of one of the three kinds of cookies must be made on Friday.

A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
This is not possible, as the first batch of sugar cookies is made on a day before Thursday, and Monday is not a day before Thursday.

B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
