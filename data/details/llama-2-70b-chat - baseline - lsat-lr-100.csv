Explanation:
The given statements imply that there is a strong correlation between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and those that won prizes at international film festivals. Therefore, it is likely that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were also Canadian films. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because it states that most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to support this claim.

Option B is incorrect because it states that most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. However, the given statements only mention that the films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian, not that all Canadian films were shown at the festival.

Option D is incorrect because it states that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. This statement is true, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the films that won prizes at the two types of festivals.

In contrast, television executives do not have the same goal because their profitability does not depend on the number of viewers in the same way.

Option C provides the best explanation for this difference. The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to generate more revenue from ticket sales to cover their production costs and make a profit. In contrast, television executives have lower production costs and generate revenue from sponsors, who are concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers.

  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.
  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.
","  Answer: E

The statement E, ""Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953,"" if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described in the question.

The question states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953, but meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. This suggests that there must be another factor contributing to the increase in recorded tornadoes.

Option E provides a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. If many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953, then it is likely that more tornadoes are being reported and recorded now than in the past. This increased reporting could contribute to the observed increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually, even if the actual number of tornadoes occurring has not changed.

None of the other options provide a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. Option A is not relevant to the issue at hand, as it merely states that meteorologists did not have as much knowledge about tornadoes before 1953. Option B states that the intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded. Option C states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years, which does not address the larger trend of an increase in recorded tornadoes since 1953. Option D states that the amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded.",,,E,0,477,396,873,

  D: everyone who understands the difference between hot and cold composting understands at least the basics of composting
  E: no gardening book that includes an explanation of at least the basics of composting is flawed
","  Answer: C

Explanation: 
The argument requires the assumption that an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting. The argument states that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting, and the difference between hot and cold composting is a fundamental aspect of composting. Therefore, Choice C is the best answer.

Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not assume that some gardening books that recommend tilling the soil and adding compost are not flawed. Instead, the argument suggests that any book that recommends adding compost without explaining the basics of composting is flawed.

Choice B is also incorrect because the argument does not assume that gardeners should not add compost to the soil unless they have a thorough understanding of composting. While it may be ideal for gardeners to have a thorough understanding of composting, the argument only requires that gardening books that recommend adding compost explain the basics of composting.

Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not assume that everyone who understands the difference between hot and cold composting understands at least the basics of composting. While understanding the difference between hot and cold composting is an important aspect of composting, it is not necessarily a guarantee that a person understands all the basics of composting.

Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not assume that no gardening book that includes an explanation of at least the basics of composting is flawed. While it may be true that a book that includes an explanation of the basics of composting is less likely to be flawed, the argument only asserts that a book that recommends adding compost without explaining the basics of composting is flawed.",,,C,0,503,408,911,

The argument assumes that the correlation between high-fther diets and low colon cancer rates is causal, with fther consumption being the sole factor responsible for the difference. However, this overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fther may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. Choice E acknowledges this by stating that foods containing fther also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer.

  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.

The other choices do not strengthen the microbiologist's argument:

* Choice A is not relevant to the microbiologist's argument, as it does not address the relationship between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance.
* Choice C is the opposite of the microbiologist's argument, as it suggests that antibiotic resistance contributes to the bacteria's resistance to heavy metal poisoning, rather than the other way around.

Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be significantly greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance, making it a flawed argument.

","  Answer: A

Explanation:
The principle states that challenge can provide useful insights into one's weaknesses. Option A conforms to this principle as it suggests that a concert pianist should not have a entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. This implies that the pianist is using the challenge of the difficult performance to gain insights into their own weaknesses and improve their performance.

Option B, C, D and E do not conform to the principle. Option B talks about the satisfaction of making a sale and how it reflects well on a salesperson's personality, but it does not relate to gaining insights into one's weaknesses. Option C talks about the value of compassion for enriching the lives of others, but it does not relate to personal self-knowledge. Option D talks about the value of competition, but it does not mention anything about gaining insights into one's weaknesses. Option E suggests that people should accept invitations to speak before large groups, but it does not relate to gaining insights into one's weaknesses through challenge.",,,A,0,535,267,802,

","  Answer: B

Explanation:
The question asks for the choice that is most similar to the reasoning above, which is: ""Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.""

The correct answer is B, ""When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.""

This answer choice uses the same type of reasoning as the original scenario. In both cases, there are two equally desirable options, and the person chooses one of them based on a specific characteristic (in this case, the price or the fact that it's the first ride). The other options do not use this type of reasoning, and some of them are even opposite in their logic.

For example, choice A states that Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties. This is the opposite of the reasoning in the original scenario, where Ed chooses the more expensive option.

Choice C is also different, as it states that Asteroid Y's orbit is more eccentric than asteroid X's because it's affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This has nothing to do with choosing between two equally desirable options.

Choice D states that Miyoko will probably not enter this program because she has no desire to take a class in physics or art. This is not similar to the original scenario, as Miyoko is not choosing between two equally desirable options.

Choice E states that the rabbit being pursued by a fox will try to double back on the fox because there's no nearby cover. This is also different from the original scenario, as the rabbit is not choosing between two equally desirable options.",,,E,0,670,446,1116,

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

The principles stated by the lawyer most strongly support judgment (B), in which police department investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of a consulting firm's central computer without seeking permission from the firm's owners. The investigators had reasonable grounds for believing that the files might contain evidence of fraudulent business practices, and although the files ultimately provided no evidence of wrongdoing, the investigators' action was still considered justified under the lawyer's principles.

In judgment (A), Sunok's action was considered justified because she had Rey's permission to use the store owner's computer. However, the lawyer's principles do not address the issue of permission from the computer's owner, but rather focus on the use of the computer in the operation of a business and the existence of reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding.

In judgment (C), the police officer's action was considered not justified because the files on Natalie's computer were not used in the operation of her business, and there was no evidence that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that the files might contain evidence usable in a legal proceeding.

The judge's reasoning is most supported by the principle that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance. The defendant's confusion about whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building does not excuse his noncompliance with national building codes. This is because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense, and the defendant is still responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, even if he is unsure about which laws apply.

  E: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.
","  Answer: E

The editorial argues that long breaks in the school calendar should be removed because they were originally intended to accommodate agricultural life, which is no longer relevant to most citizens. The editorial suggests that a school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would better serve the interests of children. Therefore, the assumption on which the editorial's argument depends is that a school calendar without long breaks would be more beneficial for children than the current calendar with long breaks.

 Choice E, ""A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks,"" accurately reflects this assumption.

 The other choices do not accurately reflect the assumption on which the editorial's argument depends.

 Choice A, ""During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned,"" may be a potential drawback of long breaks, but it is not an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends.

Explanation:
The argument states that some corporations feign a concern for the environment, thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment. This is similar to the original argument, which states that only a minority of people who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice, thus, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action. Both arguments use a faulty reasoning that a small percentage of the whole (corporations or people) means that none of the whole (corporations or people) have a particular characteristic (genuine concern for the environment or sense of social justice).

Choice A is not similar to the original argument. It states that most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes, thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars. This argument does not use the same faulty reasoning as the original argument.

Choice B is also not similar to the original argument. It states that only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters, thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.

  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
","  Answer: E

Explanation:
The argument claims that the average citizen of the town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. However, if a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes, then the increase in calls involving violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an increase in the overall risk of violent crime for the average citizen. This weakens the argument by suggesting that the increase in reported violent crimes may be due to a small number of repeat offenders rather than a widespread increase in violent crime.

","  The answer is E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.

The argument concludes that consumers who do not bother to acquire detailed information about a product are behaving rationally. This conclusion follows logically if we assume that consumers who do not expect the benefits of acquiring such information to outweigh the costs and difficulties do not bother to acquire it. Therefore, choice E is the best answer.

Choice A is not necessarily true. Even if rational consumers who do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs do not bother to acquire detailed information, it does not mean that all consumers who do not acquire such information are rational.

Choice B is also not necessarily true. It is possible that, in some cases, it may be rational to acquire detailed information even if the benefits do not outweigh the costs.

The mayor claims that new recycling projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing overall environmental damage.

The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if choice  is assumed.
The ethicist argues that if ""love"" in marital vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love ""until death do us part"" makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. This argument assumes that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. Therefore, choice  is the best answer.

It is not necessary to assume that none of our feelings are within our control (choice  A) or that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense (choice  D) to reach the ethicist's conclusion. Choice  C is incorrect because the ethicist's argument does not rely on the assumption that ""love"" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.

","  Answer: 
The argument's flawed pattern of reasoning is most similar to choice E.

Explanation:
The argument's flawed pattern of reasoning is based on the fact that it makes a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is not representative of the population. In the argument, the conclusion that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly is based on the fact that most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month, but this sample of people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month is not representative of the population of Hallstown.

Similarly, in choice E, the conclusion that most of Janine's friends are good drivers is based on the fact that she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends. However, this sample of Janine's friends who she accepts rides from is not representative of all of Janine's friends, and therefore the conclusion about most of Janine's friends being good drivers is not valid.

The other choices do not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning:

* Choice A: This argument is based on the fact that there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland, which suggests that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice B: This argument is based on the fact that John does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice C: This argument is based on the fact that all of Fernando's friends can drive and all of his friends go to school. This argument is not based on a sample that is not representative of the population, and therefore it does not have the same flawed pattern of reasoning as the original argument.
* Choice D: This argument is based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.

Explanation:
The art critic argues that Nan Paulsen's reviews of automobiles should not have received the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism because cars are utilitarian objects, not works of art, and therefore, they do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This argument is supported by choice B, which states that reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.

  D: Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site.
  E: The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact.
","  Answer: C

The archaeologist argues that the mosaics should have been left in their original location because future archaeologists studying the site may be misled by their absence. The best way to justify this argument is to assume that the materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location (choice C). If the materials used in the mosaic are not readily apparent, then future archaeologists may not be able to accurately determine the history of the site, and the absence of the mosaics could lead to misinterpretation.

A: The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological. This choice does not address the potential impact of removing the mosaics on future archaeological study.

B: Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time. This choice is not relevant to the issue of whether the mosaics should have been removed.

The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in choice D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.

Explanation:
Both the argument and choice D share a similar pattern of reasoning, which is:

1. If A occurs, B will happen.
2. B occurs if C is true.
3. Therefore, if C is true, A will occur.

In the argument, A is ""the bird feeder will not attract many birds,"" B is ""the bird feeder lacks a protective cover,"" and C is ""squirrels eat from the bird feeder."" The argument concludes that if C is true (squirrels eat from the bird feeder), then A will occur (the bird feeder will not attract many birds).

Similarly, in choice D, A is ""a tire will wear out prematurely,"" B is ""the tire's pressure is too low,"" and C is ""the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly."" Choice D concludes that if C is true (the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly), then A will occur (the tire will wear out prematurely).

Both the argument and choice D contain a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because B follows A, A must follow B. In other words, just because a low tire pressure or a lack of protective cover on a bird feeder can lead to a particular outcome (premature tire wear or squirrels eating from the feeder), it does not mean that the outcome is guaranteed to occur every time those conditions are present. There could be other factors at play that influence the outcome.

Therefore, choice D is the best answer.",,,B,0,714,478,1192,

Robinson argues that the museum did not waste its money because displaying the props and costumes is the only way of making them available to the public. However, this does not address Wexell's point that the items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance. Robinson's argument assumes that the only way to make the items available to the public is to display them in a museum, but this is not necessarily true. There are other ways to make the items available to the public, such as through photographs, videos, or online exhibitions, which do not require the museum to purchase and display the physical items. Therefore, Robinson's conclusion that the museum did not waste its money is not necessarily true, as there are other alternatives that could have been explored.

  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
","  Answer: C

The ethicist's argument concludes that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. The ethicist suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, choice C, which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.

The other choices do not support the ethicist's argument. Choice A states that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed. Choice B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This choice also does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.

Choice D states that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This choice suggests that our inclination to blame or praise someone for an action may depend on how much information we have, but it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.

Finally, choice E states that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.",,,C,0,552,456,1008,

","  Answer: 
The conclusion follows logically if choice B is assumed: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases. If the population lacks access to vital information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, they will be less able to make informed decisions about their economic activities, which can lead to economic crises. This answer choice aligns with the context, which states that the lack of information available to the vast majority of the population in certain countries can lead to more frequent economic crises.

The other answer choices do not logically lead to the conclusion. Choice A states that people without political power are more likely to suffer from economic crises, but this does not necessarily relate to the availability of information. Choice C mentions that economic crises are common in nations where the government controls access to information, but this does not imply a causal relationship between the two.

Explanation:
The medical researcher's argument is based on the assumption that stretching before jogging has no effect on the prevention of injuries. However, choice C states that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps where the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little or no effect. This implies that stretching before jogging may not be effective in preventing the types of injuries that are most common among joggers.

  D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage.
  E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.
","  Answer: The correct answer is choice B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.

The argument states that the macaques' behavior of entering the hot spring was not observed before 1963, but became adopted by the entire troop by 1990. This suggests that the behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.

Since the game's puzzles and plot are engaging, even casual players become preoccupied with completing it, which suggests that players are spending a significant amount of time playing the game. The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game means that there is a high likelihood that many players who rent the game will not be able to complete it within the two-day rental period. As a result, these players are likely to purchase the game to continue playing it, which will increase sales.

  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.
","  Answer: ""D""

The fact that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls (D) is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.

The study aims to compare the memory abilities of Group A (people aged 65-75) and Group B (college students). The conclusion is that Group A is better at remembering to make a phone call at a specified time than Group B.

Option D does not provide any information that would affect the conclusion. Even if both groups had equal access to phones, it does not necessarily mean that the difference in memory abilities between the two groups can be attributed to age. Other factors such as lifestyle, habits, and individual differences could still be at play.

On the other hand, options A, B, C, and E provide important information that supports the conclusion. Option A ensures that the sample size was the same for both groups, which helps to minimize any potential bias. Option B ensures that the same researchers answered the calls, which helps to maintain consistency in the data collection process. Option C ensures that there were no older individuals in Group B, which helps to isolate the effect of aging on memory. Option E ensures that both groups received their instructions at approximately the same time, which helps to minimize any potential confounding variables related to the timing of the instructions.

Explanation:
The argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the reason for the reduction of emotional stress, without considering the possibility that other factors, such as the release of endorphins or the act of expressing emotions, may also play a role in reducing stress. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon (the shedding of tears) with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon (the reduction of emotional stress).

The fact that there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument. This information supports the idea that if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in that neighborhood. It also suggests that the high number of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights may contribute to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

The other options do not provide as much relevant information for evaluating the argument:

A: Whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners is not directly relevant to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

C: Whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city may be relevant, but it does not specifically address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

D: Whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood may be relevant, but it does not directly address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.

","  Answer: A

The statement ""Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection"" must be true based on the given information.

The curator states that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Additionally, the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. This means that all the prints in the museum store are of works that are either on loan or in the permanent collection, which makes option A the correct answer.

Option B: This statement is not necessarily true, as the museum store may sell prints of works that are not twentieth-century works.

Option C: This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be works displayed in the museum that are not in the museum's permanent collection and for which prints are not available in the museum store.

The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it.

The argument assumes that the press has an obligation to publish any story of interest to the public, simply because they have the right to do so. However, this does not necessarily follow. Just because the press has the right to publish a story, it does not mean that they are obligated to do so. The press may choose to exercise their right to publish, or they may choose not to, depending on various factors such as ethical considerations, public interest, and the potential impact on private individuals.

  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is ""talk"" therapy.
","  Answer: 
The correct answer is choice B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by ""talk"" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.

The argument assumes that the chemical changes in the brain that occur as a result of talk therapy are the sole cause of the corresponding improvements in behavior. This assumption is necessary to support the idea that physicians will eventually be able to treat patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through talk therapy. If other factors, such as changes in the patient's thoughts or emotions, also play a role in the improvements, then the argument would not be valid.

  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.
","  Answer: D

Explanation:
The principle that environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment supports the Figorian Development Commission's position. According to this principle, environmental regulation should focus on preventing further damage to the environment rather than trying to address past harm. Since the Figorian Development Commission argues that Figorian wetland development would not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, this principle would support their position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife.

The other options do not support the Figorian Development Commission's position:

A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's call for regulation to protect wildlife, as it suggests that international agreements should be in place to regulate national resources when wildlife is endangered.

B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. This principle would also support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that the need to preserve wildlife for future generations is more important than economic needs.

C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage. This principle would not support either side, as it suggests that regulation should only be implemented after damage has been done, whereas the Figorian Wildlife Commission is calling for preventative regulation.

E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. This principle would support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, as it suggests that it is unwise to allow further depletion of natural resources.",,,C,0,605,402,1007,

  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games produced by other companies.

Answer: C

Explanation:
The fact that the copy protection feature makes the game playable for a short period before the user decides to purchase it supports the president's prediction of increased sales. This feature will encourage people who would otherwise copy the game to purchase it instead, thereby increasing sales.

Option A does not directly support the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.

Option B does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.

Option D does not provide support for the president's prediction. Even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.

The person in the game assumes that the group's answers are related to a dream, and they try to construct a coherent narrative based on the yes-or-no answers they receive.

  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","  Answer: E

Explanation:
The passage states that ""there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions"" and that ""not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva."" It also states that ""a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats."" From this information, we can infer that it is impossible to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer, as different people may react differently to the same cat. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about different breeds of cats.

Option B is incorrect because the passage states that all cats are capable of provoking allergic reactions, but it does not say that all cats will cause an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.

Option C is incorrect because while the passage states that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva, it does not necessarily follow that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than those of other allergy sufferers.

  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.
","  Answer: 
The assumption required by the curator's argument is:

D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.

The curator's argument relies on the idea that the legs of the hippopotamus were broken off intentionally, as part of a religious ritual. If the legs were broken off naturally, through some accident or natural process after the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb, then the curator's conclusion that it was a religious object would not be supported. Therefore, assumption D is necessary for the curator's argument.

Here's how the other choices relate to the question:

A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument does not rely on the age of the person buried in the tomb.

B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument does not rely on the specific use of earthenware figures in ancient Egypt.

C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.

","  Answer: C

Explanation:
The argument ""Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits"" is an example of affirming the antecedent, a type of logical fallacy. The argument assumes that because most mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, therefore, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.

The argument ""Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring"" is also an example of affirming the antecedent. The argument assumes that because most nature photographers find portrait photography boring and most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries, therefore, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.

The other options do not exhibit the same pattern of flawed reasoning:

Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.

Explanation:
Both the argument and choice A present a similar pattern of reasoning. They assert that success in a particular field does not require excellence in all aspects, citing examples of individuals who have succeeded despite only excelling in one area. They also imply that meeting certain standards in one area can compensate for average performance in another.

In the argument, success in retail does not require excellence in both convenience and variety of merchandise, as some successful retailers excel in only one of these areas. Similarly, in choice A, success in long-distance races does not require above-average speed and endurance, as some champions win by excelling in only one of these aspects.

The other choices do not present the same parallel structure:

B: This choice presents a different scenario, where success in a long-distance race can be achieved by excelling in either speed or endurance, but not necessarily both. However, it does not address the idea that average performance in one area can be compensated by excellence in another.

  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
","  Thought: 
The fact that heavily trafficked highways have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents may seem counterintuitive, but there are several factors that could contribute to this phenomenon. One possible explanation is that drivers on these highways are more cautious and alert due to the high volume of traffic, which could reduce the likelihood of accidents. Another factor could be that heavily trafficked highways tend to have better maintenance, lighting, and safety features compared to less trafficked roads. Additionally, drivers who are commuting to or from work, as suggested in choice C, may be more alert and attentive to their surroundings due to their familiarity with the route.

  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do
","  Answer: ""B""

Explanation:
The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. This assumption may not always hold true, as many technological advancements have both benefited society and been commercially successful. For instance, the development of the internet has revolutionized communication and has been a lucrative business venture. Therefore, the argument's assumption that technological advancements are driven solely by personal gain rather than societal benefit is flawed.

The professor's argument is based on the premise that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas and make intellectual progress. The conclusion that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress logically follows if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought (choice E).

  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
","  Answer: A

The argument states that lawmakers in certain jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as they have mandated identical penalties for both crimes. Option A supports this argument by stating that lawmakers generally mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe results from those crimes. This means that lawmakers consider the harm resulting from theft and bribery to be equal, which strengthens the argument.

Option B is irrelevant to the argument, as it only states that lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. It does not address the penalties mandated for those crimes.

Option C is also irrelevant, as it only states that lawmakers may mandate increased penalties for a crime in response to unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of that crime. This does not address the general sentencing guidelines for theft and bribery.

Option D is incorrect, as it states that victims of theft are harmed no more than victims of bribery are harmed. This does not address the penalties mandated for the crimes, and it could be argued that victims of bribery may suffer greater harm due to the corrupt nature of the act.

Option E is incorrect, as it states that mandating penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes will effectively deter crime. While this may be true, it does not directly support the argument that lawmakers consider the harm resulting from theft and bribery to be equal.",,,A,0,547,373,920,
