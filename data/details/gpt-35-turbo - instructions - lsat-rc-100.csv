  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A. However, upon reflection, I realized that the objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. The reason for this objection is that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Therefore, the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden, and the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.

The question asks for an example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage. The passage explains that increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products the factory can produce per worker. This creates a natural tendency toward monopoly, as larger firms can achieve lower costs than smaller firms. The correct answer should reflect this idea.

Passage A and Passage B present different perspectives on the reliability of fingerprint evidence. Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and has withstood the test of time, and that while further testing and development of standards may be desirable, there is no reason to reject it outright. Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It also raises questions about the error rate for fingerprint identification and the likelihood of two partial prints from different people matching. Based on this analysis, the correct answer should be C: tentative in its claims.
