Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. However, in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. This suggests that the environment has changed in a way that favors the sheep with light wool. If a new predator is introduced to the island, the sheep with dark wool may be more vulnerable because they are larger and easier to spot. Therefore, the population of sheep with dark wool may decrease, and the population of sheep with light wool may increase.
