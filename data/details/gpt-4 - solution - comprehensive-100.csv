Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24

  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Thought: 
The length of the fence is composed of the width of the pickets and the space between them. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets, the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches. So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1). To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). First, simplify the equation: 1/2x + 6(x-1) = 1/2x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6. Then, convert to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 = (13x - 12) / 24. So, the answer is E: (13x - 12) / 24.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12
Simplify to get (13X-12)/24

Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 
Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 
The total amount is 8600, so we can set up the equation:

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and then we can find out how much each daughter receives.
First, simplify the equation: 
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 8600 / 43 = 200

Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 . Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41 .Choice $A$ is incorrect; the numbers 3 and 5 are possible values for $a$ and $b$, but not possible values for $c$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; if $a=5$ and $b=3$, then 6 and 35 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(5 x+2)(3 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+35 x+6 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 6 and 35, the value of $c$ is 41 and not 6 and 35. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect; if $a=3$ and $b=5$, then 10 and 21 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(3 x+2)(5 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+21 x+10 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 10 and 21 , the value of $c$ is 31 and not 10 and 21 .",D,D,1,582,6,588,

","Thought: 
The line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If this line passes through the origin, then the slope must be the same when x=0. So, we need to solve the equation (32-k)/(k-2) = k/2. Solving this equation gives k = 4.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$. Therefore, of the given choices, only 8 could be the value of $k$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and may be the result of computational errors.",B,C,0,484,119,603,

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives -x - y = -8. Therefore, x - y = 8.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Multiplying each side of the equation $2 x-3 y=-14$ by 3 gives $6 x-9 y=-42$. Multiplying each side of the equation $3 x-2 y=-6$ by 2 gives $6 x-4 y=-12$. Then, subtracting the sides of $6 x-4 y=-12$ from the corresponding sides of $6 x-9 y=-42$ gives $-5 y=-30$. Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is $2-6=-4$.Alternatively, adding the corresponding sides of $2 x-3 y=-14$ and $3 x-2 y=-6$ gives $5 x-5 y=-20$, from which it follows that $x-y=-4$.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are incorrect and may be the result of an arithmetic error when solving the system of equations.
