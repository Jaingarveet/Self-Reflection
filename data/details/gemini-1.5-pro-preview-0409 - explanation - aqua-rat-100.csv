","Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. I initially focused on maximizing single-letter codes, which led to a suboptimal solution. 
The key is to efficiently use both single and double-letter codes. 
With 4 letters, we can create 4 single-letter codes and 6 double-letter codes (combinations of 4 items taken 2 at a time), totaling 10 unique codes, which is the minimum required.
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",B,D,0,422,105,527,

I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. The key is to focus on the relative speed of Alex and Jacob, not their individual times. 
Action: Answer(""[REDACTED]"") 
","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

I recall this question and my previous incorrect response. 
The key is to accurately set up the trigonometric ratios based on the changing angle of elevation and then solve for the time it takes to reach the base of the tower.
Action: Answer(""[REDACTED]"") 
","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Since B bisects minor arc AC, and the measure of arc AC is 160°, then the measures of arcs AB and BC are each 80°. 
The measure of arc ABD is the sum of arcs AB and BD, which is 80° + 150° = 230°.
Since a full circle is 360°, the measure of minor arc AD is 360° - 230° = 130°.

","B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees. Now , we have arc BD = 150, therefore CD = 70.

","Thought:
The team lost 30% of their matches, so they won 70% of their matches. 
We know they won 20 matches, which represents 70% of the total matches.
To find the total number of matches, we can set up the equation: 0.7 * Total Matches = 20
Solving for Total Matches, we get: Total Matches = 20 / 0.7 ≈ 28.57
Since the team cannot play a fraction of a match, we round the total number of matches to the nearest whole number, which is 29.
Therefore, the team lost 29 - 20 = 9 matches.

","Knowing that the team lost 30 % of their matches, it has won 70 % of their matches

I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. 
The key is to establish the relationships between the different bread types and their falafel content. 
Let's analyze step-by-step:
* 6 pitas = 2 rolls
* 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
We need to find the equivalence between baguettes and pitas.
From the first statement, 1 roll is equivalent to 3 pitas (6 pitas / 2 rolls).
Substituting this into the second statement, we get 3 * (3 pitas) = 5 baguettes, which simplifies to 9 pitas = 5 baguettes.
Therefore, 1 baguette is equivalent to 9/5 pitas.
The question asks for the equivalent of 2 baguettes, so 2 * (9/5 pitas) = 18/5 pitas.

The key is to focus on the time window where catching either train is possible, which is between 5:00 AM and 5:10 AM. 
Within this 10-minute window, the man will catch the harbor line train if he arrives within the first 2 minutes (a 2/10 probability) and the mainline train if he arrives in the remaining 8 minutes (an 8/10 probability). 
These are mutually exclusive events, so we add the probabilities.

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the chairs are identical. This means that the order of the children matters, but their specific positions on the chairs do not. 
Since Susan must be to the left of Tim, we have two possible arrangements:

* Zen - Susan - Tim 
Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the children.

We know C invested for some months and got 150,000 out of 375,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit.
This means the profit share ratio between A, B, and C is 3:2:5.
We need to account for both the investment amount and time to find the actual ratio of their investments.
Let x be the number of months C invested. 
The investment ratio will be: (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 12) : (120,000 * x)
This simplifies to: 4 : 6 : 12x
Now we equate this to the profit share ratio: 4/12x = 3/5
Solving for x, we get x = 5/9 months.
However, this is the time C invested since the start of the business. We need to find how many months after B joined.
So, the answer is 5/9 - 2 = -13/9 months.
