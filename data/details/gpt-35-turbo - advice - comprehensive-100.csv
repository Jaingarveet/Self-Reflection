  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m

  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
","Choices:
  A: 50 m
  B: 75 m
  C: 100 m
  D: 125 m
  E: 150 m
","Self-reflection:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.
We are given the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point, which is 5 seconds. We can use this to find the time it takes for the shuttle to travel 700m, which is 40 seconds. 
Using the formula, we can find the speed of the shuttle, which is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
To find the length of the shuttle, we need to know the time it takes for the entire shuttle to pass a point. Since we know it takes 5 seconds for a part of the shuttle to pass a point, we can assume that the entire shuttle is passing the point for 5 seconds as well. 
Using the formula, we can find the length of the shuttle, which is speed x time = 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m.
I made a mistake in my previous answer by not considering the time it takes for the entire shuttle to pass a point. 
Correct Answer: Answer(""B"") 75 m","Let the length of the space shuttle be x metres and its speed be y m/sec. Then, x / y = 1 ⇒ y = x / 5
∴ (x + 700) / 40 = x / 5 ⇔ x = 100 m. Answer C",B,C,0,451,227,678,

","Choices:

  B: 20
  C: 25
  D: 26

","Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the ages of the members can be represented by the A.P. 7, 7 + 3, 7 + 6, ..., 7 + 3(n - 1).
The sum of an A.P. is given by the formula S = n/2(2a + (n - 1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the given values, we get 250 = n/2(2(7) + (n - 1)(3)).
Simplifying the equation, we get 5n^2 - 35n - 1000 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula, we get n = 20 or n = -25.
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the answer is n = 20.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Let, n be the number of members in the club.Then,
250 =(n x [2×7+(n+1)×3/12]) / 2.

Option C is a general statement about the relationship between land development costs and house prices, which may or may not be true, but it is not as specific as the first two options.

The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries because both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that suggests stretching before jogging may help prevent injuries.
Option A does not weaken the argument because it suggests that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries during the study than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
Option B does not weaken the argument because it suggests that many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
Option C does not weaken the argument because it suggests that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.

The concept of increasing returns to scale is described as the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more products the factory can produce per worker.

To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method.
From the second equation, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x=2y+19$.
Substituting this expression for $x$ into the first equation, we get $3(2y+19)+4y=-23$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $10y=-80$, which implies $y=-8$.
Substituting this value of $y$ into the expression for $x$, we get $x=2(-8)+19=-5$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(-5,-8)$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",A,B,0,450,152,602,

To solve for $P$, we need to isolate $P$ in the given formula.
We can start by multiplying both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side to get rid of it in the denominator of the left-hand side.
Then, we can simplify the expression and isolate $P$.

  C: 8
  D: 16
","Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 4
  C: 8
  D: 16
","Thought:
The line passes through the origin, so the equation of the line is $y = mx$. 
Substituting the given points, we get $k = 2m$ and $32 = km$. 
Solving for $m$, we get $m = \frac{32}{k}$. 
Substituting this into the first equation, we get $y = \frac{32}{k}x$. 
Since the line passes through the origin, we have $k = 2m = \frac{64}{k}$. 
Solving for $k$, we get $k^2 = 64$, so $k = \pm 8$. 
Therefore, the answer is either $\textbf{(C)}$ or $\textbf{(E)}$.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.
