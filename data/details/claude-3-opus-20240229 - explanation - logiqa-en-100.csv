  D: Unless your company is doing its best in at least one thing, it cannot succeed in market competition.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The paragraph states that to start your own company, ""you have to know that you are great in one thing"". This suggests being the best in at least one area is a requirement, not just an advantage.
2. It then lists examples - your product is better, you are faster, you have lower cost, or you have higher added value. The implication is you need to be the best in one of these areas compared to competitors.
3. The phrasing ""when others are doing as well"" and ""when others have the same cost"" reinforces that being the best in one dimension is necessary to differentiate yourself, especially if competitors match you in other areas.
4. The paragraph focuses on what's needed to start a company and gain an initial foothold, not necessarily long-term success. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This captures the main idea but doesn't convey the necessity as strongly as the original text.
B) While aligned with the main point, ""likely to lose out"" is a bit weaker than the paragraph suggests.
C) The paragraph doesn't guarantee huge profits, just the ability to get started and compete.
D) This matches the absoluteness of the original phrasing - ""have to"" and ""cannot succeed"" convey being the best in one area is a requirement to get your company off the ground, not just an advantage.
Therefore, D is the closest match to the meaning and specifics of the original paragraph.

5. Condition (4) is satisfied as M is in the printing group. 
6. Condition (5) is satisfied as H is in both groups.

","You're right, I made an error in my previous reasoning. Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The first premise states the microorganism ""usually breeds above freezing"". The key word is ""usually"" - this implies that while it typically breeds above freezing, there may be some exceptions where it can breed at or below freezing temperatures.
2. The second premise states the lake is currently frozen, meaning it is at or below freezing temperature. 
3. The conclusion is that if the microorganism is present, it will not reproduce now. This seems highly likely given the premises - the organism usually needs above freezing temps, and it is currently freezing.
4. However, the conclusion is not absolutely certain. There is a small possibility the microorganism could still reproduce in the current freezing conditions, since the first premise allows for some exceptions to the ""usual"" behavior.
Therefore, while the conclusion is highly probable based on the premises, it is not 100% certain. There is a small chance it could be false.

  C: The degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious than in developing countries.
  D: Polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than in developed countries.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The economist's argument relies on a few key points:
1) Transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries improves the environment in developed countries. 
2) This transfer pollutes the environment in developing countries, but provides employment and tax revenue that compensates for the pollution.
3) As a result, both sides benefit and global welfare increases.
The hypothesis underlying this argument is an assumption about the relative value or importance of a good natural environment in developed vs developing countries.
The economist seems to be assuming that a good natural environment is more important or valuable to people in developed countries than to people in developing countries. That's why transferring pollution to developing countries, in exchange for economic benefits, is seen as a net positive.
None of the other choices capture this core hypothesis:
- B and C are statements of fact, not hypotheses 
- D is about relative profitability, not environmental values
Therefore, the hypothesis discussed by the economist is best represented by choice A.

","You're right, upon further reflection I see that Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's argument by pointing out it lacked persuasion and jumped to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
Xiao Chen argued that since people don't normally observe distant comets flickering, this instance of Comet 1996D3 flickering must be unusual. However, Xiao Wang countered that the flickering was only discovered through ""continuous and careful tracking observation"", implying that the lack of past observations may simply be due to comets not being observed closely enough, rather than this being an unusual event.
So Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen by disagreeing with the logic and persuasiveness of the argument, not the conclusion itself. Xiao Wang provided an alternative explanation for the lack of past flickering comet observations to undermine Xiao Chen's reasoning.
Therefore, the method Xiao Wang used is best summarized by choice B: ""pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.""

1. There are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 handsome man among the 4.
2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors. 
3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.

From (4), Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. So if Li Qiang is tall, then Wang Wei is not tall. But we need 3 tall men total. 
The only way to have 3 tall men is if:
- Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are both tall (from 3)
- Wu Gang is tall (to have 3 total tall men)

The other answers do not address this competitive ecological relationship between the two species.

","Thought process:
The argument concludes that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave based on archaeological evidence like tools and pottery found inside. To refute this, we need a fact that contradicts people using the cave as a dwelling.
A) The cave inspiring descriptions of hell doesn't refute people living there. Mythology could arise separately from or even because of past habitation.
B) The cave being a cemetery and funeral venue would directly contradict it being a living space. Burying the dead in the same place hundreds of people lived is unlikely. This strongly refutes the conclusion.
C) The relative age of prehistoric villages in Europe has no bearing on whether people lived in this specific cave. It's irrelevant to refuting the argument.
D) The entrance collapsing 5000 years ago doesn't refute people living there during the much older Neolithic period when the tools and pottery originated. Later inaccessibility doesn't mean the cave was never inhabited.
Therefore, B is the only choice that, if true, would refute the argument that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave. It provides an alternative explanation for the archaeological evidence that logically conflicts with using the cave as a dwelling.

2. Looking at each choice:
A) ""A listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends.""

2. ""Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs"" means ""hostage holding (see) reporter""
3. ""Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits"" means ""kidnapping reporters away""

Since ""Mugbudengs"" means ""reporters"", by process of elimination, ""Doximayo"" must mean either ""student"" or ""hostage"". 
To determine which, let's look at sentence 2:
""Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs"" = ""hostage holding (see) reporter""

Looking at the choices:
A: This supports the expert's view by suggesting the bridge is hindering transport of goods. It does not raise doubts.
B: This directly contradicts the expert's claim. If 99% of large international ships moor below the bridge anyway, demolishing it to allow their passage seems unnecessary. This casts significant doubt on the expert's assertion.
C: This suggests the problem is broader than just the Nanjing Bridge. While relevant context, it doesn't directly challenge the expert's specific claim about the Nanjing Bridge.

This offers an alternative explanation for the population decline that the experts did not seem to consider. If environmental changes are significantly impacting the salamanders' water sources, that could be a major factor in their decline, casting doubt on whether livestock trampling is the primary cause.
Choice C states the salamanders hide under rocks during the day, potentially avoiding livestock trampling. However, they may still be vulnerable when they emerge, and this doesn't rule out cumulative impact from livestock over time.

3. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to find an explanation for why the accident rates could be similar despite differing enforcement.
Looking at the choices:
A. Severe investigations occurring in urban accidents doesn't explain the similarity across cities with different enforcement levels.
B. If cities with strict enforcement still have drunk driving occurring, that could explain why their accident rates aren't lower than cities without enforcement. The enforcement may not be effective enough to actually change behavior and outcomes.
C. While improving safety awareness is important, this doesn't directly address the seeming discrepancy between enforcement levels and accident rates.
D. Stopping other traffic violations is a good idea in general, but doesn't clearly explain the similar accident rates despite different drunk driving enforcement.
Considering all this, B seems to provide the best explanation - if drunk driving is still occurring in the strict enforcement cities, just at a reduced rate, that could lead to the survey results.

1. We are told that if He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the two girls selected.

   - Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together
   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together 
   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together
3. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected due to condition (1).
4. This leaves us with Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai as possible selections for the 3 boys.
5. However, due to conditions (2) and (3), if either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai is selected, then the other cannot be. 
6. This means we must select Qiu Zhijie and Ren Xiangyang, plus either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai.
Therefore, the person who is definitely not selected is Tang Xiaohua.

A: This points out the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world that the senses are supposed to be perceiving in the first place. It is a valid doubt.
B: Questioning how we can prove others have similar experiences casts doubt on part of the argument's evidence. It's a relevant challenge.
C: Stating that mirages are real existences rather than illusions actually supports the reliability of visual experience and the external world. It does not express doubt.
D: Highlighting the success of natural science, which relies on an external world, provides support for that external world's existence. Like C, it is not a rebuttal but an additional point in favor of the argument.
Therefore, C is the choice that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.

  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to ""Inferno"" magazine.

The argument concludes that some advertisers consider not just economic benefits, but also ethical responsibilities, based on the example of advertisers refusing to renew contracts with ""Bay"" magazine after it changed to more violent and pornographic content as ""Inferno"".
To strengthen this argument, we need additional evidence that the advertisers' decision was based on ethical considerations rather than just economic factors.
Looking at the choices:
A) Lower cost and selling price of ""Inferno"" compared to ""Bay"" would suggest economic reasons for advertisers leaving, weakening the argument. 
B) If the advertisers maintained their benefits after switching to other publications, this supports the idea that they left ""Inferno"" for non-economic reasons, strengthening the argument.
C) Reader preferences don't directly relate to the advertisers' motivations.
D) Some clients switching to ""Inferno"" suggests ""Inferno"" is still economically viable, but doesn't address the original advertisers' reasons for leaving.

2) Posts about negative issues like crime and violence have increased by 90% in the same period
The question asks which answer choice, if true, would most weaken this argument.
A) This choice just states a common saying, but doesn't provide any information to weaken the argument.
B) If the number of internet users has quadrupled, that could explain the increases in both positive and negative posts without the social atmosphere actually deteriorating. More users would naturally lead to more posts of all kinds. This weakens the argument.
C) The existence of some people spreading online rumors for profit doesn't directly address the overall increases in positive and negative posts that the argument is based on.
D) The forum being legal suggests it is moderated and operating within the law. This makes it less likely the increased negative posts truly indicate a deteriorating social atmosphere, as a legal forum would restrict truly egregious content. So this also weakens the argument.
Between B and D, B seems to weaken the argument more, as it provides an alternative explanation for the post increases that doesn't require the social atmosphere to be deteriorating at all. The legal status in D makes the conclusion a bit less likely but doesn't completely undermine it.
