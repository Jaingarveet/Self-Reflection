The authors of Passage 1 believe that women should not aspire to exercise political rights and functions because their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and duties of motherhood set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties and summon them to gentle occupations and cares of the home.
It can be inferred from this statement that the authors believe running a household and raising children entail activities that are gentle and not strenuous or onerous.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 state that women should seek ""gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" so they can avoid performing difficult, or ""strenuous,"" and unpleasant, or ""onerous,"" tasks.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors of Passage 1 do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require professional or political skills.",C,C,1,1735,107,1842,

Explanation:
The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. To answer this question, we need to look at the table and find the column for colonies without colony collapse disorder. Then, we need to scan the answer choices and identify the pathogens listed: IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, and Nosema ceranae. Next, we need to look at the table again and find the row for each pathogen listed in the answer choices. Finally, we need to compare the percentages for each pathogen and identify the highest percentage. The pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder is Nosema ceranae, with a percentage of 81%. Therefore, the correct answer is D.","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",D,D,1,1837,182,2019,

","Thought:
The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord is brief and not very detailed. However, it does show that Miss Spivey expects the students to have heard of Columbia University and is surprised when Ralphord asks what she studied at ""Barnyard College."" This suggests that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. In the second paragraph, Miss Spivey tells her class that she went to Barnard College in New York City, which prompts Ralphord to ask her what she studied at ""Barnyard College."" In response, Miss Spivey explains that Barnard College ""was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard."" This interaction implies that, contrary to Miss Spivey's expectations, the names of prestigious East Coast schools aren't common knowledge among her pupils. Thus the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.Choice B is incorrect because the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord establishes an atmosphere of misunderstanding, not friendliness. Choice C is incorrect because Ralphord's question demonstrates his naivety rather than his precociousness.

  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.

  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","Thought:
The narrator is described as shy when she calls Big Uncle's name and reserved when she makes weak efforts to leave with Old Widow Lau. The narrator is also described as attuned to her immediate surroundings when she tries to notice everything so she could later tell GaoLing what she had seen. However, the narrator's shyness and reluctance to stay in the shop are more prominent than her attentiveness to her surroundings.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage.

The passage suggests that planting crops would have reduced the percentage of the surface covered with weeds because the crops would have competed with the weeds for resources.
The passage states that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
Therefore, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth.

Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control.

Explanation:
The main purpose of the first paragraph is to analyze Chie's reaction to Akira's untraditional approach to asking for her daughter's hand in marriage. The paragraph questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if Akira had followed tradition. The focus is on Chie's reaction and not on describing a culture, criticizing a tradition, or questioning a suggestion.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1798,95,1893,
