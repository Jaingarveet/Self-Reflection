The statements above indicate that it is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate and difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate.

","Self-reflection:
The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain, based on an experiment where most patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain. To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that provides a counter-argument that is stronger than the evidence presented. Option A is not relevant because it does not address the effectiveness of magnetic fields. Option B is not relevant because it presents a different treatment method, not a counter-argument to the effectiveness of magnetic fields. Option C is not relevant because it does not address the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain. Option D is not relevant because it does not address the effectiveness of magnetic fields. Option E is the most relevant because it suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have affected the results, making it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of magnetic fields.

  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.
","Self-reflection:
The argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning known as the fallacy of composition, which assumes that what is true of the parts is true of the whole. The argument assumes that because most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. 
I chose answer choice D, which presents a different pattern of flawed reasoning known as the fallacy of division, which assumes that what is true of the whole is true of the parts. 
The correct answer is answer choice B, which presents a similar pattern of flawed reasoning known as the fallacy of division. The argument assumes that because most migratory birds have left the region by the end of November, then few birds remain in the region during the winter.

","Thought:
The phenomenon described is that highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Choice C provides a direct explanation for this phenomenon, as most of the motorists on heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work, which means they are likely to be more cautious and familiar with the road.

The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is used to support the main conclusion that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. It is not the main conclusion of the argument, nor is it a claim that the argument tries to rebut.

","Thought:
The argument claims that technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole because those responsible for technological advances are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. This assumes that technology beneficial to society cannot be commercially viable. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible for technology to be both commercially viable and beneficial to society. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable.

  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
","Thought:
The argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate an identical penalty for both crimes. To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
A: This statement is generally true but does not provide any evidence to support the argument.
B: This statement is also generally true but does not provide any evidence to support the argument.
C: This statement is not relevant to the argument.
D: This statement provides evidence that supports the argument. If the harm resulting from theft is no greater than the harm resulting from bribery, then it makes sense for lawmakers to mandate an identical penalty for both crimes.
