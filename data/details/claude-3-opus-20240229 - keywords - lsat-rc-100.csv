  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the key points from the self-reflection:
1. The third paragraph discusses critics who argue that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. 
2. These critics believe that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting that culture's own, often non-scientific, perspectives and methods.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) Comparing moral codes doesn't necessarily rely on Western scientific methods, so the critics may not object.
B) Studying a culture's literature to understand its values uses the culture's own perspective, which the critics would likely approve of.
C) This directly describes using Western scientific methods to study a non-scientific culture, which is exactly what the critics in the third paragraph are objecting to.
D) Using one culture's theories to study another's literature could be seen as imposing an outside perspective. However, it's not clearly using Western scientific methods.
E) The critics are concerned about using Western methods to study other cultures, not about using those methods to examine Western culture itself.
4. Choice C most clearly matches the kind of study that the third paragraph critics would find objectionable - using Western scientific methods to investigate a non-scientific culture.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage presents three positions on the role of literature:
   - Art stands above everyday reality 
   - Art must depict concrete reality and contribute to social change
   - Dostoyevsky's view that reality shaped by the perceiver is literature's source, and literature's merit lies in its artistry
2. The first two positions are stated briefly without much elaboration. 
3. Dostoyevsky's position, the third one, is then explained in much greater detail. The passage expands on what Dostoyevsky means by reality, his view on the fantastic in literature, his disagreement with judging literature by political utility, and his definition of artistic merit.
4. The first two positions are used mainly as a contrast to set up the detailed explanation of Dostoyevsky's differing perspective. 
5. Therefore, the passage structure can be best described as presenting three positions, with the third (Dostoyevsky's view) differentiated from the first two in detail.

A) This would support, not call into question, the author's assertion.

E) The relative number of African American authors writing about music is not directly relevant to the author's main assertion.
Choice B is the best answer. If other African American authors had already used musical structures in their novels, it would make Morrison's achievement in Jazz seem less groundbreaking and original, calling into question the author's claim that ""none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so.""

","Thought process:
Both passages discuss the lack of objective standards and error rates in fingerprint identification. Passage A argues that despite the lack of uniform standards, fingerprint evidence has been reliably used for a long time and has a low error rate based on examiner testimony. Passage B counters that without agreed-upon standards for declaring a match and data on error rates, the value of fingerprint evidence cannot be properly assessed.
The common underlying principle is that to evaluate the reliability and value of fingerprint evidence, there need to be known error rates - i.e. how likely it is that prints from two different people would be declared a match. Passage B states this directly, while Passage A implies it by citing testimony about low error rates to support the reliability of fingerprints.
The other choices focus on narrower details from one passage or the other, rather than the overarching principle connecting the two. Synthesizing the arguments holistically reveals that known error rates are the key point of agreement between them.

A) This aligns with the author's view that the twofold obligation allows lawyers to balance their responsibilities to defendants and the court/society. The author seems confident this is the right approach.
B) The passage suggests lawyers should not take cases where they know the client is guilty, but the twofold obligation itself doesn't necessarily prevent this. 
C) The twofold obligation is more about lawyers' ethical responsibilities than uncovering facts.

  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
","You're right, I made some mistakes in my previous attempt. Let me carefully re-read the passage and question to avoid those pitfalls.
The key points from the passage are:
- Before the 1930s, some theoretical physicists calculated that splitting atoms should be possible in principle
- In the 1930s, researchers like Fermi bombarded uranium with neutrons and produced new radioactive substances
- However, they did not recognize that these substances were the result of splitting uranium atoms
- This was partly due to difficulties analyzing the substances, but more so because they did not expect fission was occurring
- In 1938, Hahn identified barium as one of the products, which surprised him as it seemed impossible based on what they thought was happening 
- Meitner finally realized the significance - that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms via nuclear fission
The question asks what was true of the physics community in the 1930s. Looking at the answer choices:
A) The passage states they overlooked the possibility of fission in the neutron bombardment experiments, despite earlier theoretical calculations. This seems to match the information in the passage.
B) The passage does not mention them reevaluating the earlier calculations about splitting atoms. It's not supported.
C) The passage says the by-products remained unidentified for a while, but Hahn did eventually identify barium in 1938. So this is not true for the entire 1930s decade.
D) The passage does not compare the ease of splitting different atoms. It only discusses uranium.
E) The passage briefly mentions dangers of working with radioactive materials hampering chemical analysis, but this is a minor point. It does not say the physics community as a whole recognized these dangers in the 1930s.
After carefully considering the question and reviewing the relevant information in the passage, I believe A is the best answer. The physics community did neglect the earlier theoretical possibility of splitting atoms when interpreting the results of the 1930s neutron bombardment experiments.

  E: Widespread familiarily with new ways of storing information will be the primary reason for the acceptance of the new digital model.
","Thought process:
The question asks what the author would most likely agree with regarding the transition to the new digital publishing model. 
The passage focuses on how the digital model will eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. The author believes digital publishing will become widespread once the catalog of digitized books is large enough to justify the investment in printing machines.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) The passage does not discuss changing literary tastes as a factor. 
B) The author does mention that keeping books ""in print"" digitally is an advantage, but it's not presented as the primary factor.
C) While the author discusses demands of literary agents for higher royalties, this is portrayed more as an effect of the transition rather than the main impetus.
D) The passage does not mention innovative marketing strategies.
E) The author attributes the likely acceptance of the model to its economic efficiency and convenience, not familiarity with new information storage.
Of the choices, B seems to align best with the author's argument, though it may not capture the full scope. The ability to keep any digitized book ""in print"" is cited as a key benefit that, combined with the cost savings, will lead to the digital model eventually rivaling or replacing traditional publishing.

Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence is reliable and has withstood the test of time, despite some areas for improvement. It makes more definitive claims.

Passage B uses more tentative language like ""how likely"", ""no fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively"", and discusses criticisms of proficiency tests. It is more skeptical and questions key assumptions behind fingerprint analysis.
So compared to Passage A, Passage B is more tentative in its claims. It raises doubts and questions rather than making confident assertions.

  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that proverb use in Mexican American communities serves to ""foster a consciousness of ethnicity"" and provides a means of ""enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage.""
2. This suggests that proverb use functions to convey a sense of Mexican American ethnicity and cultural heritage to children in those communities. 
3. While the passage discusses some specific ways proverbs are used (e.g. to teach table manners or regulate peer relationships), the broader implication is that proverb use in general, even proverbs without an explicitly didactic purpose, serves to transmit language, culture and a sense of ethnic identity.
4. The passage does not suggest that the ways Mexican Americans use proverbs are necessarily typical of all Spanish speakers worldwide. It also does not claim that an emphasis on peer relationships is unique to Mexican American communities.
5. While the passage notes proverbs can be understood independent of verbal context, with meaning shaped by social context, this is presented as a general definition of proverbs rather than the main implication about ethnicity and cultural transmission.

  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The sentence at lines 7-11 states the view of some legal scholars that ""lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.""
2. The sentences at lines 28-31 state: ""When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.""
3. These two passages present contrasting viewpoints. The first argues lawyers should not judge guilt and just represent the defendant. The second argues when lawyers know the defendant is guilty, they have a duty to acknowledge that and argue for leniency rather than innocence.
4. So the relationship is the author expressing their own opinion that contrasts with and opposes the opinion of the legal scholars reported earlier in the passage.
Therefore, the best answer is B - the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines.

2) The second version takes a neutral stance on cultural values but still uses Western scientific methods to study other cultures. 
3) Critics argue this is still distorting because it privileges scientific discourse over the myth, tradition, religion etc. that are dominant in many non-Western cultures. They say real understanding requires adopting the perspectives of the cultures being studied.

A) This doesn't address the criticism. Even if impossible, it doesn't refute that using Western methods distorts understanding of other cultures.
B) The similarity or difference between non-Western value systems is not relevant to the criticism about using Western methods.
C) This provides a counterargument to the criticism. If some non-Western cultures use their own values to study other cultures, that suggests using one's own cultural methods does not necessarily prevent genuine understanding. It weakens the claim that only adopting the other culture's perspective allows real understanding.
