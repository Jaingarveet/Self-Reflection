The author's argument is that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power. The answer that most undermines this connection is choice D, which suggests that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

Explanation:
The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the first to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. The question asks which statement would call the author's assertion into question. Choice D states that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.

A: In at least some cases, the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindered the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively.
B: The corrido is unique among ballad forms because it uses language that is familiar mainly to local audiences.
C: Much of the imagery used in corridos can also be identified in ballads from Spain.
D: The reportorial capability of corridos was probably enhanced by their freedom from the constraints of rhymed ballad forms.
E: A corrido without a surviving despedida would lack an important marker of its uniqueness and generic continuity.

The passage does not mention anything about the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindering the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively, so A is incorrect. The passage does not state that the corrido is unique among ballad forms because it uses language that is familiar mainly to local audiences, so B is incorrect. The passage does not mention anything about the reportorial capability of corridos being enhanced by their freedom from the constraints of rhymed ballad forms, so D is incorrect. The passage does mention that the despedida, or formal closing verse, is a clear marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, so E is likely the correct answer. The passage also mentions that corridos have roots in eighteenth-century Spain, so C is also a possible answer. However, the passage does not specifically state that much of the imagery used in corridos can also be identified in ballads from Spain, so C is less likely to be the correct answer than E.

The author's primary purpose in the passage is to describe a particular aspect of one work by a particular writer, specifically how Toni Morrison uses jazz as a structuring principle in her novel Jazz. The author discusses how the narrative slips easily from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, and how this is analogous to the playing of a jazz band. The author also highlights how Morrison's use of language and narrative point of view serves to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.

The primary substances are described as necessary for growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
The author's purpose for discussing primary substances is to help distinguish between the two types of substances found in plants.

The author of passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules. The plan described in passage B involves selectively enforcing the rule only against certain individuals to achieve a particular goal, which is an example of discretionary nonenforcement. The author of passage A would likely agree that the plan described in passage B is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, as it reduces the costs of overinclusion without creating underinclusion.
