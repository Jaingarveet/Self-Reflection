The study employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which would be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

The other options do not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures and therefore would not be considered objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education:

A: A study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a comparative study that aims to understand the differences between various moral codes.

B: A study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study of the culture's own values and beliefs.

D: A study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study that aims to understand and critique the literature of a particular society using the values and beliefs of that society.

  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
","  Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, as it best exemplifies the author of passage B's characterization of evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory."" The author suggests that genes may promote their own propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. This implies that the mother's behavior is not solely motivated by her own interests or desires, but is also influenced by an interest in promoting the survival and replication of her genes. This is an example of the kind of ""conspiracy"" that the author of passage B is referring to, as it attributes an interest in gene propagation to the mother's behavior without her conscious awareness or acknowledgment.

The other options do not clearly exemplify this aspect of evolutionary psychology. Option A is a general statement about the approach of evolutionary psychology, which does not necessarily imply a ""conspiracy theory."" Option B is a statement about the difficulty of explaining altruism from an evolutionary perspective, which does not necessarily involve attributing hidden motives to individuals. Option C is a description of altruistic behavior, which does not necessarily imply a hidden interest in gene propagation. Option E is a statement about the living arrangements of early humans, which is not directly relevant to the concept of evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory.""",,D,D,1,1552,314,1866,

The passage suggests that increased specialization leads to increased productivity, but there may be limits to this specialization. If specialization leads to higher training costs and increased turnover, then it's possible that the benefits of increased specialization may be offset by these costs. Therefore, option E, which states that any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover, undermines the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to misinterpreting the question and focusing on the wrong aspect of the passage.
I should have paid closer attention to the language used in the question and the passage, and considered the main point of the passage more carefully.
I have now re-read the passage and considered the options more carefully, and I believe the correct answer is E.

Answer: E

Explanation:
Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology can account for altruistic behavior, which seems to be problematic for a theory that emphasizes individual reproductive success.
The passage suggests that altruistic behavior can be understood as a result of psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which were initially aroused by cues of kinship or familiarity and increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance.
This would enhance the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy, thereby promoting the propagation of genetic material.
Therefore, option E accurately states the main point of passage A.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior diminishes the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it.
Instead, it explains how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage mentions new evidence that may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, it does not state that this evidence shows that genes promote their own self-propagation.

Option C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that humans no longer live in small, kin-based groups, it does not suggest that altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary purposes that it does not serve today.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage mentions that critics of evolutionary psychology argue that most significant types of human behavior are not prompted by genetically selfish motivations, it does not take a position on this issue.
Instead, it focuses on explaining how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Explanation:
The author provides a translation of a proverb in lines 32â€“33 primarily in order to illustrate how a proverb can function as an appeal to traditional wisdom. The proverb ""Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are"" is used to convey the idea that the company one keeps has a significant impact on one's identity and behavior. By citing this proverb, the author suggests that parents use proverbs like this one to appeal to traditional wisdom and bolster their authority when teaching their children about peer-group relationships. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Self-reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question as option A. Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to my failure to carefully consider the context in which the proverb was being used. I mistakenly assumed that the proverb was being used primarily to illustrate the relation between proverb use and education about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities (option A).

The second and fourth lines are variable, with the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

In my previous answer, I mistakenly chose option B, use of numerous figures of speech, as the characteristic of corridos. I realized that my mistake was due to my misinterpretation of the passage. The passage actually states that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners.

Explanation:
The passage discusses the potential health benefits of moderate wine consumption, specifically citing the presence of natural compounds found in grapes that may contribute to these benefits. The author argues that the assumption that alcohol is the only active ingredient in wine, beer, and distilled spirits has led scientists to overlook the unique effects of wine consumption. The passage also mentions studies that have found slower absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream from wine compared to other alcoholic beverages, as well as links between wine consumption and increased clot-breaking activity and decreased platelet adhesiveness.

The correct answer choice, E, accurately summarizes the author's main point by stating that wine appears to have significant healthful effects that are not present in other alcoholic beverages, and that these effects may be due to natural compounds found in grapes.

  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","  Sure! Here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""E"")

Explanation:

The author's attitude toward the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is best described as ""convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers."" The author argues that defense lawyers have a responsibility to the court and to society, as well as to their clients, and that this responsibility does not interfere with their ability to provide the best possible defense for their clients. The author does not express any concern about the potential for conflict of interest that may arise when defense lawyers are obligated to both their clients and the court. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Self-reflection:

In my previous answer, I selected option A, ""confident that it enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option does not accurately capture the author's attitude toward the twofold obligation. The author does not express confidence that the obligation will enable defense lawyers to balance their responsibilities; rather, the author simply acknowledges that the obligation exists and argues that it does not interfere with the lawyer's ability to provide the best possible defense. Therefore, option E is a better fit for the author's attitude.",,E,E,1,1069,306,1375,

The final sentence of the passage provides context for the caution exhibited by traditional publishing conglomerates in approaching digital publishing. It suggests that the hesitation is due to the typical adjustments that occur during the transition between economic models. This context helps to clarify the situation facing traditional publishers, who are resistant to change due to their investment in traditional practices and infrastructure. Therefore, the primary purpose of the final sentence is to provide a broader context that helps to clarify the situation facing traditional publishers, making option B the correct answer.

It is important to note that option A is incorrect because while the sentence does suggest that traditional publishing houses have been slow to embrace digital publishing, this is not its primary purpose. Option C is also incorrect because while the sentence summarizes the argument for the claim that digital publishing will likely replace traditional publishing, it does not provide a comprehensive summary of the entire passage. Option D is incorrect because while the sentence mentions the obstacles facing traditional publishing houses, it does not identify a primary obstacle.

Option B refers to enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent, which is the opposite of capricious enforcement. Option C prioritizes enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes, which may be a factor in law enforcement decisions, but it is not the same as capricious enforcement.

","  Answer: D

Explanation:
The best answer is choice D: In recent years, the city has rarely, if ever, turned off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills.

The passage states that officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. This implies that the city has not been vigilant in enforcing water bill payments in the past. The passage does not provide information to support the other choices. Choice A is not necessarily true, as the passage only mentions that 231,000 water customers are late paying their bills, without specifying the proportion of customers this represents. Choice B is also not necessarily true, as the passage does not mention the distribution of overdue water bills across different neighborhoods. Choice C is not supported by the passage, as it does not suggest that it is appropriate to turn off the water of high-income residents who pay their water bills late. Choice E is not a reasonable conclusion, as the passage does not mention anything about enacting a law to classify water bills as taxes.

","  Sure! Here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""E"")

Explanation:
The passage highlights the role of corridos in promoting cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions. The author notes that corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. The use of familiar imagery, such as storm imagery, and ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another, are examples of these conventions. The passage also notes that the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, is a set convention that asserts the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished. Therefore, option E, ""The corrido is a type of folk song that promotes cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions,"" accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

Self-reflection:
In my previous answer, I selected option A, ""Corrido imagery is one of the clearest indicators of the unique cohesiveness of Border communities."" While the passage does mention the importance of imagery in corridos, it does not emphasize it as the main point of the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, which states that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

Reflection:
I initially chose option B, thinking that it best aligned with Lichtenstein's use of comic book imagery to parody high art. However, upon further consideration, I realized that option A better captures the spirit of Lichtenstein's work. Like Lichtenstein, the painter in option A uses realistic techniques to represent simple objects, but does so in a way that is playful and ironic, rather than serious and high-minded. This approach aligns with Lichtenstein's use of comic book imagery to comment on the pretensions of the art world, while also conveying a sense of nostalgia and innocence. In contrast, option B's use of stick figures to parody human figures is more overtly satirical and less nuanced than Lichtenstein's approach. Options C, D, and E, on the other hand, do not seem to be in keeping with Lichtenstein's style or themes.",,A,E,0,1141,232,1373,

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Based on my previous reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question and focused on the benefits of digital publishing rather than the factor that will drive the transition to the new digital model.

The author of the passage suggests that the transition to the new digital model will be driven by the economic efficiency and convenience for customers, as well as the elimination of whole categories of expenses. The author also mentions that literary agents will demand a larger share of the proceeds for their authors, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to adapt to the new model.

Therefore, the answer that the author would most likely agree with is:

B: The ease of keeping books ""in print"" will be the primary factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model.

The author suggests that the ability to print books on demand and the elimination of the costs associated with traditional publishing will make digital publishing more efficient and cost-effective. This, in turn, will make it easier for authors to publish their work and for readers to access a wider range of books.

The other options do not accurately reflect the author's views on the transition to the new digital model. Option A is not supported by the passage, as the author does not mention changing literary tastes as a factor in the transition. Option C is also not supported, as the author does not suggest that literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition.

The passage suggests that proverbs serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity within Mexican American communities, and that they provide a means of enhancing young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition. This implies that the frequent use of proverbs within these communities functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to my misunderstanding of the question. I was focusing too much on the idea that proverbs are used to inculcate table manners, and I didn't consider the broader context of proverb use within Mexican American communities.

Reflection:

Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as ""B: Wholly unregulated economies are probably the fastest in producing an equalization of social status.""

Upon reflection, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the relative speed of equalization of social status in different types of economies. Instead, the passage focuses on how the market system can lead to the diffusion of new technology across society, thereby contributing to a democratizing force.

Therefore, the best answer is ""C: Expanded access to printed texts across a population has historically led to an increase in literacy in that population."" This statement is supported by the passage, which mentions the example of the printing press and how it made written materials more widely available, leading to an increase in literacy.

The other options are not supported by the passage. Option A is not mentioned in the passage, and option D is not supported by the passage, as the invention of the telephone is not discussed.

","  Sure! Here's my revised answer:

The relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and that in the sentence at lines 7-11 can most accurately be described as E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.

In the earlier lines (7-11), the author presents the opinion that defense lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false to the court, but rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, considering the facts on both sides, and present any extenuating circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing if sincerely believed to be warranted.

In the later lines (28-31), the author further expounds on this idea by stating that lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for the defendant, but instead, advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case. The author emphasizes that the lawyer's obligation to the court and society also ultimately benefits the defendant, as the ""best defense"" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case.

Therefore, the two sets of lines present the same idea from different perspectives. The earlier lines focus on the lawyer's obligation to the court and society, while the later lines emphasize the importance of the lawyer's role as an advocate for the defendant's rights. However, both sets of lines convey the same message that defense lawyers should not present false assertions to the court and should instead strive to provide the best possible defense for their clients while also upholding their obligations to the court and society.

The reference to railroads serves to call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory.

","  Sure! Here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage suggests that the author would agree with statement B, that the corrido is unique among ballad forms because it uses language that is familiar mainly to local audiences. The author highlights the use of conventional and recognizable imagery in corridos, such as storm imagery, which reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. Additionally, the author notes that the despedida, or closing verse, of a corrido is a set convention that varies according to exigencies of rhyme, indicating that the corrido's maker is asserting that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished. This suggests that the author values the corrido's ability to evoke a sense of local culture and community through its use of familiar language and imagery. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Self-reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A, stating that the dependence of corridos on ready-made lines hindered the efforts of corrido makers to use metaphor effectively. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage does not suggest that the use of ready-made lines hinders the use of metaphor. Instead, the passage highlights the use of conventional imagery and language in corridos, which serves to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.

Reflection:

Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realized that the passage does not support a direct correlation between the diversity of secondary substances and the number of insects interacting with a plant population. Instead, the passage suggests that insects have played a role in the development of secondary substances in plants, but does not specify the nature of this relationship.

Option D, on the other hand, accurately reflects the idea that insects have influenced the presence of certain secondary substances in plants, without necessarily dictating the specific substances that appear. This option acknowledges the role of insects in shaping plant chemistry without overstating their influence. Therefore, I have changed my answer to option D.",,D,D,1,1207,182,1389,

","  Sure! Here's my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The author discusses metaphor in the second paragraph primarily in order to emphasize the centrality of poetic language to corridos. The author notes that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, but when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. The author also highlights the use of storm imagery in corridos, which is a conventional and recognizable element of the corrido tradition. This emphasis on poetic language and imagery suggests that the author sees it as an important aspect of the corrido genre. Therefore, choice C is the best answer.

Self-reflection:
In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose choice A, elaborating on a claim about the directness of the language used in corridos. I realized that my mistake was due to a misreading of the question, as the author does not actually discuss the directness of the language used in corridos in the second paragraph. Instead, the author focuses on the use of metaphor and poetic language in corridos.

The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel.

The passage discusses two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding, with critics arguing that both proposals are unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system. The first proposal is criticized for approaching other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values, while the second proposal is criticized for using Western scientific methods to study cultures, which are value-laden and may not be appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures.

Based on the passage, the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" mainly refers to its ability to serve a particular political view or purpose. This is evident in the radical critics' demand that art must be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society. Dostoyevsky, however, rejects this view and argues that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit"" rather than its usefulness.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: ability to help bring about social change.

This answer is supported by the passage, which states that the radical critics believed that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.

","  Answer: C

The passage explains a theory that neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, and it presents evidence that has helped the theory gain acceptance in the scientific community. It also describes an obstacle to the theory's general acceptance - the difficulty some scientists had imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. The passage then presents an explanation that helps the theory overcome this obstacle, by describing the structure of receptors and how they mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. Finally, the passage discusses a further implication of the theory - the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage states that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility that atoms might be split, and that their research was hampered by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, option [REDACTED], ""The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products,"" would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Without preconceived notions about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, the physicists would have been more open to considering alternative explanations for the data they were collecting, including the possibility of nuclear fission. This would have allowed them to recognize the significance of the evidence more quickly and come to the conclusion that atoms were being split sooner.

The other options do not address the key issue of the physicists' expectations and preconceptions, and therefore would not have had the same impact on the amount of time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split.",,B,B,1,1516,277,1793,
