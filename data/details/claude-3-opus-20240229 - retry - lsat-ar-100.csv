  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This is a fixed condition.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. 
3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. Combined with condition 2, this means either one or two witnesses testify on Monday, and the remaining one or two testify on Wednesday along with Iturbe.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday. 
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. 
   This is possible. Garcia, Hong and Jackson could be scheduled for Tuesday, and Iturbe on Wednesday.
B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. 
   This is possible. Franco and Iturbe could testify on Wednesday, with Garcia, Hong and Jackson on Monday and Tuesday.
C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
   This is possible. They could be the two witnesses testifying on Tuesday.
D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
   This is impossible. We know Hong cannot testify on Monday, so if Garcia is the only one on Monday, Hong must be on Tuesday or Wednesday. But we also know Iturbe must be on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses are on Tuesday. So Hong cannot be on Wednesday.
E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
   This is possible. Two of Franco, Garcia, and Hong could testify on Monday, Jackson and the remaining one on Tuesday, and Iturbe on Wednesday.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint is that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least 3 spaces between the restaurants.
Looking at each choice:
A) If a restaurant must be in space 3, 4, or 5, then the other restaurant would have to be in space 1 or 7 to satisfy the original constraint. This is more restrictive than the original.
B) If a restaurant is next to the optometrist or veterinarian, this doesn't ensure the restaurants are separated by 2 businesses. It's less restrictive than the original.
C) If the toy store or veterinarian is between the restaurants, this guarantees at least 2 spaces between them, just like the original constraint. It has the same effect.
D) If no more than 2 businesses separate the pharmacy and nearest restaurant, this doesn't address the separation of the two restaurants. It's not equivalent.
E) The optometrist not being next to the shoe store is unrelated to the restaurant separation and thus not equivalent.
Therefore, choice C is the only one that would have the same effect as the original constraint.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This means spaces #1 and #2 are open for others.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson. Since Robertson has #3, the only options for Young are #1 and #2. 
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Young. Since Young has to be in #1 or #2, the only option for Togowa is #1.
4. So if Robertson is in #3, then Young must be in #2 (to be lower than Robertson but higher than Togowa).
5. Xu must be higher than Souza. The remaining spots are #4, #5 and #6. Souza and Xu could be arranged in any of those in a way that fits this rule.
6. Vaughn gets whichever of #4, #5 or #6 is left after assigning Xu and Souza.

1. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. So if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, Olivia must lead a Wednesday session (since those are the only two days left).
2. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's. Since Olivia is leading a Wednesday session, Julio must also lead a Wednesday session.
3. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. Since both Wednesday sessions are taken by Olivia and Julio, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Thursday sessions.
4. The only remaining lab assistant is Nessa. We're told Nessa must lead an afternoon session. The only afternoon session left is on Friday. So Nessa will lead the Friday afternoon session.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, both Kevin and Rebecca must lead Thursday sessions.
Since the question only asks for one lab assistant, either Kevin or Rebecca is a correct answer. I'll choose Kevin arbitrarily.

1. There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom). 
2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf. With 8 books total, the only way to arrange this is 2-2-4 or 2-3-3.
3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So it must be a 2-3-3 arrangement (2 on top, 3 in middle, 3 on bottom).
4. I is on the middle shelf. 
5. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So F and M must be on the bottom, and K must be on the middle or top.
6. O is on a higher shelf than L. So L must be on the middle or bottom, and O must be higher than L.

2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the plays Jiang reviews are different from those reviewed by Lopez and Megregian. 
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So we know at least one play each of them reviews.
4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s) as each other. Given #3, this must be Kramer and O'Neill, as they both review Tamerlane.
5. Since Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays, and we know Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian (#1), O'Neill must also review fewer plays than Megregian.

5. Since Irving must report on the afternoon following Nina, he cannot give a morning report. Therefore, the morning reports must be given by Helen, Kyle and Lenore.
6. The only way to satisfy all the conditions is:
   Monday morning: Helen, Kyle or Lenore
   Monday afternoon: Nina
   Tuesday morning: Helen, Kyle or Lenore

1. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, so we only need to consider the other 6 students.
2. George can only give a report on Tuesday. So if he's giving a morning report, it must be on Tuesday morning.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they are giving reports, they must be in the morning.
4. If Nina gives a report, then the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). 
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) Helen, George, and Nina - This could work. Helen and Nina could go Monday and Wednesday morning, with George on Tuesday morning.
   
   B) Irving, Robert, and Helen - This doesn't work. If Robert goes in the morning, he must go Monday or Wednesday. But then Irving and Helen would need to go the next day, which isn't possible.
   
   C) Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This doesn't work. If Nina goes Monday, then Helen and Irving must go Tuesday. If Nina goes Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must go Wednesday. Either way, Olivia can't fit.
   
   D) Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This doesn't work for the same reason as B. Robert must go Monday or Wednesday morning, forcing Irving to go the next day, but that's not what's listed.
   
   E) Robert, George, and Helen - This works. Robert Monday morning, George Tuesday morning, Helen Wednesday morning.
Therefore, the possible correct answers are A and E. But E makes the most sense logically, as it spreads out the morning reports evenly among Robert, George, and Helen.

  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. We need to find an equivalent constraint.
A) This is the converse of the original statement. It says if Kayne is assigned, then Jaramillo must be. This is not equivalent, as the original allows Kayne to be assigned without Jaramillo, but not vice versa.
B) This introduces a new condition about Landon and Ong, which is not related to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.
C) This also introduces Ong, who was not part of the original constraint. It also allows for the possibility of neither Kayne nor Ong being assigned, which the original did not address.
D) The original constraint requires Kayne to be assigned if Jaramillo is, but this choice prohibits them from being assigned together. Not equivalent.
E) Like B and C, this introduces Ong and Novetzke, who were not part of the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.
After analyzing each choice, A comes closest but is not fully equivalent. None of the others maintain the same relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne's assignments as the original.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know G is fourth. This means J must be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd since J must be earlier than G.
2. S must be earlier than Y. And consecutive articles can't cover the same topic. So the nutrition articles (Q, R, S) and the wildlife article (Y) must alternate.
3. S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. But G is fourth, so Q can't be third. Therefore, S must be later than Q.
4. R must be later than G. So the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, S, R.
5. Y (wildlife) must be between two nutrition articles. The only place it can go is between S and R. 
6. So far the order is:
   J (finance)

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Given the third solo is traditional, either the 2nd and 3rd solos are both traditional, or the 3rd and 4th solos are both traditional. 
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the 3rd and 4th solos are both traditional (to satisfy condition 2), then Wayne must perform the 4th solo. 
4. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. So Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the 1st or 2nd solo.
5. The pianist who performs the 2nd solo does not perform the 5th solo. This doesn't directly impact the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
Putting this together:
- Wayne must perform at least one modern piece in the 1st or 2nd solo
- If the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces, Wayne must perform the 4th solo
- Otherwise, Wayne may not need to perform any traditional pieces
Therefore, the minimum number of traditional pieces Wayne must perform is one (in the 4th solo if the 3rd and 4th are the consecutive traditional pieces).

2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means Megregian reviews at least 2 plays. 
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, neither Lopez nor Megregian can be on the list.
4. Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. The only pair we know for sure review a common play is Kramer and O'Neill (Tamerlane). So no other pair can completely overlap.

1. The panel already includes F (a botanist), L (a chemist), Q and R (both zoologists). 
2. The conditions state that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Since F is already on the panel, selecting G or H would mean having more than one botanist. And since Q and R are already selected, that would violate this condition. So G and H cannot be selected.
3. K cannot be selected because F is already on the panel, and the conditions state that F and K cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected according to the conditions. But R is already on the panel, and adding both M and P would make the panel have 6 members instead of 5. So M cannot be the fifth scientist.
5. The only remaining option is P. Selecting P satisfies all the conditions: 
   - The panel would have at least one of each type of scientist (F-botanist, L-chemist, P/Q/R-zoologists)
   - It has only one botanist (F) and more than one zoologist, which is allowed
   - It doesn't include both F and K, or both K and M

3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. So the other two batches must be on Monday and one other day (not Thursday).
4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
   If oatmeal starts Monday, the second batch can't be Monday or Thursday (sugar cookie day). Let's say it's Tuesday.

This is possible. 3 French novels could be selected to satisfy the novel requirement, plus 1 play. This totals 4 works.
B: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.

3. One kind of cookie's first batch is made the same day as another kind's third batch. This means all three batches of one of the cookie types must be completed in the first three days (Mon-Wed).

1. We know there are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. 
2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf, and there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
3. The question states that G is on the top shelf. 
4. I must be on the middle shelf according to the conditions.
5. K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M. Since there are more books on the bottom than the top, this means F and M must be on the bottom shelf, and K must be on the middle or top shelf.
6. O is on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be on the top or middle shelf.
7. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf, the only place for L is also the bottom shelf. This puts O on either the top or middle shelf.
8. H is the only unplaced book. It could go on any of the shelves while satisfying the conditions.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: H, I - This is possible. I must be on the middle shelf, and H could be there too.
B: I, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.
C: H, I, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.
D: I, K, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the shoe store is in space 2. 
2. The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy must be in space 1. A restaurant will be in space 7.
3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. With one restaurant in space 7, the other restaurant could be in spaces 1-4. But space 1 is taken by the pharmacy, so the second restaurant must be in spaces 3 or 4.
4. The pharmacy (in space 1) must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian. The toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. 
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A) The optometrist can't be in space 5, as that would leave no valid spots for the second restaurant.
B) The pharmacy being in space 1 is consistent with what we determined. This could be true.
C) A restaurant in space 3 is possible, as determined in step 3. 
D) The toy store can't be in space 6, as that would force the veterinarian in space 5, next to the toy store.

1. We know Theresa tests G on the second day. 
2. Theresa must test one of the bicycles on H, and since she's testing G on the second day, she must test H on the first day.
3. Yuki can't test J, so the only options for Yuki on the first day are F, G, or H. But we know Theresa is testing H on the first day, so Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.
4. Whichever bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, Seamus must test that same bicycle on the second day. 
5. Reynaldo can't test F. So if Yuki tests F on the first day, Reynaldo must test G on the first day (since Theresa is testing H). But then Seamus would have to test F on the second day, leaving no option for Reynaldo on the second day (since he can't test F, and G and H are already taken on the second day).
6. Therefore, Yuki must test G on the first day, and Seamus must test G on the second day.

E. Yuki tests F on the second day. This is NOT possible. Yuki must test the same bike on day 1 that Seamus tests on day 2. But Reynaldo can't test F at all.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1. 
2. Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone.
4. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. 
5. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
6. The question states Mahr and Stuckey are in the same zone.
Given 4 and 6, Mahr, Stuckey and Udall must all be in the same zone. 
If they were in Zone 1, then by 2, Tiao would have to be in Zone 2. But then by 1, Parra would have to be in Zone 3 with Quinn. This would leave only Kim for Zone 2, violating condition 5. So they can't be in Zone 1.
If they were in Zone 2, then by 2, Tiao would have to be in Zone 1 or 3. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, leaving only Kim for Zone 2, violating condition 5. If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn could be in Zone 1, but this still leaves only Kim for Zone 2, again violating condition 5. So they can't be in Zone 2.
Therefore, Mahr, Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3. This means:
- By 2, Tiao must be in Zone 1
- By 1 and 3, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 2
- This leaves Kim as the only possibility for the 4th person in Zone 3

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We have 7 articles total: G, H, J (finance), Q, R, S (nutrition), and Y (wildlife). 
2. Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic. This means the finance and nutrition articles must alternate.
3. S can only be before Q if Q is third. This means if S is 1st, Q must be 3rd. If S is 2nd, Q can be anywhere after 3rd.
4. S must be earlier than Y. So S could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th. Y could be 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th.
5. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. So the finance articles must be in the order J, G, H. And R must come after all the finance articles.
6. If H is 4th (Choice A), then J must be 1st or 2nd, G 2nd or 3rd. S and Q's positions are still flexible. So A doesn't fully determine the order.
7. If H is 6th (Choice B), then J must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th, and G must be 3rd or 5th. Again, S and Q's positions are flexible. B doesn't fully determine the order.
8. If R is 4th (Choice C), then all finance articles must come before the 4th position. So J is 1st, G is 2nd, H is 3rd. S must be before Y, so S is 5th and Y is 6th or 7th, Q is 6th or 7th. This fully determines the order.
9. If R is 7th (Choice D), J, G and H could be in positions 1-2-3, 1-2-4, 1-2-5, 1-3-4, 1-3-5, 1-4-5, 2-3-4, 2-3-5, or 2-4-5. S and Q's positions are also flexible. D doesn't fully determine the order.
10. If Y is 5th (Choice E), S must be 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th. The finance articles' and Q's positions are flexible. E doesn't fully determine the order.

3. Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic. So if J (finance) is third, a nutrition or wildlife article must be second. 
4. S must be earlier than Y (wildlife). So if a nutrition article is second, it must be Q, not S.

1. P is performed 3rd and S is performed 6th. This means there are two compositions performed between P and S.
2. O must be performed either 1st or 5th. Since P is 3rd, O must be performed 5th.
3. The 8th composition is either L or H. 
4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R.
5. There must be at least two compositions either between F and R, or between R and F.
6. There must be at least one composition either between O and S, or between S and O. We know O is 5th and S is 6th, so this condition is satisfied.
Putting this together:
- O is definitely performed 5th
- P is 3rd 
- S is 6th
- The 8th is L or H
The only possible orders that satisfy all conditions are:
1. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H
2. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H

2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Similar to the first condition, one of Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2, and the other is in Zone 1 or 3. 
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. So they are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Again, they are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.
5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This is a key piece of information.
Now, let's consider the answer choices:

3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is in the O-S pair, the pharmacy must be on one side of this pair.
4. On the other side of the O-S pair, we can't have the veterinarian, because the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. 
5. We also can't have the other restaurant on this side, because the two restaurants need to be separated by at least two businesses.

2. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. If 3 students review Undulation, Megregian must be one of them. Otherwise he would review 2 plays maximum, same as Kramer and Lopez.
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviewed Undulation, Lopez and Megregian could not, contradicting the previous point. Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation.
4. Exactly two students review the same plays as each other. If O'Neill also reviewed Sunset along with Tamerlane, he would review the same plays as Kramer. This satisfies the condition.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Bay 4 is holding produce. This is given in the question.
2. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. So textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. 
3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since textiles is in either bay 3 or 5, livestock must be in a higher numbered bay. It can't be bay 4 (produce) or bay 5 (the only option higher than bay 3 for textiles). So livestock must be in bay 6.
4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. But livestock is in the highest numbered bay (6), so this is impossible. There is no arrangement that satisfies all the conditions.
Since the given information leads to an impossible situation, not all the bays can be determined. The question asks for the number of bays that are completely determined. We know for sure the cargo of two bays: bay 4 (produce) and bay 6 (livestock).

4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. 
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. But we know at least 1 Russian work must be selected from point 2.
6. Putting this together, to satisfy all conditions, the organizer must select:
   - At least 1 Russian novel (to have a Russian work)
   - At least 1 French novel (to have at least as many French novels as Russian)
   - At least 1 play (French or Russian)
Therefore, the organizer must at least select one Russian novel and one French novel. The play could be either French or Russian.

  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know I is on the middle shelf. 
2. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
3. K is on a higher shelf than F. F and M are on the same shelf.
4. O is on a higher shelf than L.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A) If I and M are on the same (middle) shelf, then F is also on the middle shelf. But this doesn't determine the shelves for the other books. Not enough info.
B) If K and G are on the same shelf, this could be either the top or middle shelf (since K is above F). But it doesn't specify, so this doesn't fully determine the arrangement.
C) If L and F are on the same shelf, this must be the bottom shelf (since O is above L, and more books are on the bottom than top). Then M is also on the bottom. I is on the middle. K, G, H, O are left for the 2 spots on top and remaining middle spot. But it's not fully determined.
D) If M and H are on the same shelf as F, this must be the bottom shelf. I is on the middle. That leaves K, G, L, O for the 2 top spots and 1 remaining middle spot. O must be on top since it's above L. But we can't distinguish the exact spots of K, G and L.
E) If H and O are on the same shelf, it must be the top shelf, since O is above L. Then L must be middle or bottom. I is middle. F and M are together, so must be bottom to satisfy the ""more on bottom than top"" condition. This fully determines it: H, O top; I, L middle; F, M, K, G bottom.
Therefore, E is the only choice that fully determines the shelf arrangement.

  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know 9 total batches are made (3 of each kind) over the 5 weekdays. 
2. At least 1 batch is made on Monday, and exactly 1 batch is made on Friday. So Mon-Thurs must have the other 7 batches.
3. The 2nd sugar batch is made on Thursday. So the 1st and 3rd sugar batches must be on Mon, Tues or Wed.
4. The 2nd oatmeal batch is made the same day as the 1st peanut butter batch. 
5. No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This could be true. The 1st sugar batch could be Monday with the other 2 on Thurs and another day.
B: This can't be true. If the 1st oatmeal is Tuesday, the 2nd oatmeal (and 1st peanut butter) can't be Thurs (2nd sugar is Thurs). The 3rd oatmeal would have to be Fri, but Fri only has 1 batch.
C: As reasoned in B, the 3rd oatmeal batch can't be on Friday since Friday only has 1 batch.
D: This could work. The 1st peanut butter could be Wed, with oatmeal batches on Mon, Wed, Fri for example. 
E: This can't work. If the 2nd peanut butter is Tues, the 1st has to be Mon (only other option is Fri which is too late). But then the 2nd oatmeal is also Mon which doesn't work.

1. We have three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. Each client has two service targets - one for website requests and one for voicemail requests.
2. The conditions are:
   - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.
   - Image's voicemail target must be the shortest among the clients.
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
3. From the second condition, Image must have the 1-day voicemail target. And from the first condition, Image's website target can only be 1 day as well.
4. Now, for Solide and Truvest, their voicemail targets can be either 2 days or 3 days. 
5. From the third condition, Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. So if Solide's website target is 2 days, Truvest's must be 3 days. If Solide's is 1 day, Truvest's can be either 2 or 3 days.
6. In any case, a 1-day website target can only be set for Image. Solide and Truvest must have either a 2-day or 3-day website target.

  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We're told that none of the clients has a website target of 2 days. This means the website targets can only be 1 day or 3 days.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
3. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day.
4. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
   - If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's must be 3 days (since 2 days is not an option).
   - If Solide's website target is 3 days, then there's no valid option for Truvest's website target, as it can't be 2 days or shorter than 3 days.
5. So Solide's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's must be 3 days.
6. Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets could be either 1 day or 2 days (but not 3 days, as that would be longer than their website targets).
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This is true. Image and Solide both have 1 day website targets.
B: This is also true, for the same reason as A.
C, D, E: We can't determine the relative lengths of Solide and Truvest's voicemail targets, or compare Truvest's targets to Image's.

3. However, the pharmacy must also be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 4, as that is not an end. 
4. This means the pharmacy must be in space 7, at the end of the row. This is the only way to satisfy both constraints - that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian and at the end of the row.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. This means textiles and produce must be in adjacent bays.
2. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So produce must be in a higher numbered bay than fuel.
3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So livestock must be in a higher numbered bay than textiles. 
4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So grain must be in the highest numbered bay of all the items mentioned.
5. Looking at the first 3 bays (1-3), we can deduce:
   - Fuel must be in bay 1 or 2 based on the info in point 2 above.  
   - Textiles and produce can't both be in the first 3 bays, as they need to be adjacent but we know produce is higher than fuel.
   - Livestock and grain are both in higher bays than textiles, so can't be in the first 3 bays.
6. The only choice that fits is D: machinery, textiles, fuel
