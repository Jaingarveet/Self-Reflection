Explanation:
The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the first to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, not that it is the first novel to use music as a theme or metaphor. If it were true that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music, this would call into question the author's assertion that Jazz is the first novel to use a musical genre as its structuring principle.

Explanation:
The author of passage B criticizes the assumption that it is sufficient to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. This is because there are often multiple interests that could explain a given behavior, and it is not necessarily the case that the behavior would only be reasonable if one had an interest in propagating one's genes.

The passage discusses two opposing views on the purpose of literature during Dostoyevsky's time. One view held that art should stand above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art should only exist if it contributed to the creation of a new society by exposing want and injustice. Dostoyevsky took a third position, believing that literature should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that the formal aspects of a work were of primary importance. The radical critics' requirement that art must be ""useful"" to people and society seemed unsatisfactory to Dostoyevsky. However, the question asks for the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" mainly refers to its ability to help bring about social change, which aligns with the radical critics' view.

","Thought:
The author of passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules. The plan described in passage B involves selectively cutting off water to a few residences with outstanding bills in high-income neighborhoods. This plan is an example of discretionary nonenforcement, as it targets only a specific group of people who have not paid their bills.
