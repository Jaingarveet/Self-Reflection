  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
","Thought:
The original price of the computer can be found by first finding the discounted price before tax, and then finding the original price before the discount.
The discounted price before tax is 8% less than the discounted price after tax, so it is 92% of the discounted price after tax.
The discounted price after tax is the total amount paid, $p$.
So the discounted price before tax is $0.92p$.
The original price before the discount is 20% more than the discounted price before tax, so it is 120% of the discounted price before tax.
So the original price before the discount is $1.2(0.92p) = (1.2)(0.92)p = (0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p$.
To isolate $p$, we can multiply both sides by $(0.8)(1.08)$, giving us $p = (0.8)(1.08)(0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p = (0.8)(1.08)p$.
Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ is $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$. However, this is incorrect because $8 \%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them. The expression in choice $C$ results from assigning $p$ to represent the original price of the laptop, rather than to the amount Alma paid to the cashier.",D,D,1,504,286,790,

The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites.

The slope of the first equation is -3.
The slope of the second equation is -a/2.
For the system to have no solution, the slopes must be equal, and the lines must not be the same.
This occurs when the y-intercepts are different, and the slopes are equal.
To find the value of a that results in no solution, we can set the slopes equal and solve for a, but we must also ensure that the lines are not the same.
-3 = -a/2
a = 6
Since the y-intercepts are different, we need to find a value of a that results in a different line.
If we set a = 6, the second equation becomes 3x + 2y = 4, which has a different slope and y-intercept from the first equation.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $a x+2 y=4$ are represented by the expression $-\frac{a}{2}$ and the point $(0,2)$, respectively.

The given equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the left side of the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides, we get $a b=15$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides, we get $7 a+2 b=c$.
We are given that $a+b=8$.
Solving for $b$ in terms of $a$, we get $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation $a b=15$, we get $a(8-a)=15$.
Expanding this equation, we get $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$.
Factoring this equation, we get $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $a$ are $3$ and $5$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7 a+2 b=c$, we get $c=31$ and $c=41$, respectively.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

","Reflection:
I made an error in my previous response by stating that the mean would change the most when in fact, it is the range that will change the most.

Solution:
The mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the sum of the values, and therefore decrease the mean. However, since there are 21 values in the data set, the effect of removing one value will not be as significant as the effect on the range.

The median is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in order. Since there are 21 values, the median is the 11th value. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median, since it is not the 11th value.

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range, since it is the largest value. Therefore, the range will change the most if the 24-inch measurement is removed from the data.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.
