Action: Let's use the formula for the arithmetic mean to find the weight of the heavy duty truck. The formula is:

Arithmetic mean = (x1 + x2 + ... + xn) / n

where x1, x2, ..., xn are the values of the variables we are averaging, and n is the number of values.

In this case, the values are the weights of the 10 vehicles, which are given as 12.2 tons. So, we can plug this value into the formula:

Arithmetic mean = (12.2 + 12.2 + ... + 12.2) / 10

","  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The problem states that a square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. The area of the original square piece is equal to the area of the resulting rectangular piece, since the square shape is preserved.

So, the area of the original square piece is 70 square feet.

The problem also states that the rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. The area of each triangle is also 70 square feet.

Since the triangles are symmetrical, we can assume that the length of each triangle is half the length of the original rectangular piece.

So, the length of the original rectangular piece is 4 feet longer than the length of each triangle.

Now, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to find the perimeter of the original rectangular piece:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since the width of the original rectangular piece is half the length, we can substitute these values:

Perimeter = 2(4 + 2) = 20 feet

Therefore, the answer is (B) 58 feet.","Let x be the length of one side of the original square.

The production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units per month. So, the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month

The company sells all the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue per month is:

420 units x selling price per unit = $46,800 per month

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly revenue of at least:

$626,400 = 12 x $51,300 (since there are 12 months in a year)

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Revenue per month = Production cost per month

So, we can solve for the selling price per component:

Selling price per component = Revenue per month / Production cost per month

Substituting the values given in the question:

Selling price per component = $46,800 / $110 per unit = 426

So, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is:

Answer: B - 230

Therefore, the company should sell the components for at least $230 per unit to ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400.","450*12(x-110)=626400
where x is a selling cost of one item

  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
","  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so the distance traveled can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/h x 6 hours = 360 km

Now, during the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/h, so the time taken to travel the same distance can be calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 360 km / 72 km/h = 5 hours

So, the distance traveled by the jeep during the return journey is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 72 km/h x 5 hours = 360 km

Now, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep in total. Since the jeep traveled a certain distance in the forward journey, we can add it to the distance traveled during the return journey to get the total distance:

Total Distance = Forward Distance + Return Distance
Total Distance = 360 km + 360 km = 720 km

So, the distance traveled by the jeep is 720 km.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Let 'x' be the distance and 'y' be the speed of the forward journey. Then, we have 6v=d and 4(v+12)=d
=> v=d/6 and v=d/4 - 12
=> d/6 = d/4 - 12
=> d/12 = 12

Action: Answer(""B"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

"," Thought: The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled in 10 minutes is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.
The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Total amount = Monthly salary + Commission on monthly sale
= 1500 + (15% of monthly sale)

To find the monthly sale, we can set up the following equation:

Total amount = Monthly sale

Now, we can solve for the monthly sale by substituting the values given in the question:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 6000

1500 + 900 = 6000

900 = 6000 - 1500

Since the cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm

Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98

So, if John has Rs.75, then Mark giving him half of his money will give John Rs.75/2 = Rs.37.50.

Now, we are given two statements:

1. Mark will have Rs.75 if he gives John one third of his money.
2. John will have Rs.37.50 if Mark gives him half of his money.

We can set up a proportion to relate these two statements:

Mark's money = John's money / 3

Solving for John's money, we get:

Monthly salary = fixed salary + (monthly sales x percentage)

We know the fixed salary is $500, and we want the monthly salary to be $1500. So, we can set up the equation:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Now, we need to solve for the monthly sales. We can do this by isolating the monthly sales term on one side of the equation:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500

Subtracting $500 from both sides gives us:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

Now, we can divide both sides by 5% to find the monthly sales:

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000

$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) / 5% = $1000

Monthly sales = $20,000

So, we know that in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. And in 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year.

To find the total deer population in the forest, we need to use the information that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.

Let's call the total deer population in the forest ""x"".

The proportion of deer in the forest with tags is the same in both years, so the number of deer with tags in the second year is also proportional to the total deer population in the forest.

So, the number of deer with tags in the second year is:

500 (deer caught in 2002) = 0.2x (total deer population in forest with tags)

Now, we can solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.2:

x = 5000

So, the total deer population in the forest is 5000.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Let N = the total number of deer in the forest.
During the first year, the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was: 300/N
20/500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags. Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population (i.e., the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer), the two ratios are equal.

Let's call the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X 6:9, which means that for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper.

Now, let's say we have 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. We want to mix them together to form alloy Z. Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is 6 x 40 = 240 grams, and the amount of copper is 9 x 40 = 360 grams. Similarly, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is 7 x 60 = 420 grams, and the amount of copper is 11 x 60 = 660 grams.

When we mix these two alloys together, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 240 + 420 = 660 grams, and the total amount of copper is 360 + 660 = 1020 grams. So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

Zinc:Copper = 660:1020 = 69:101

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 69:101.","The ratio of zinc and copper in mixture 1 is 6/9 and in mixture 2 is 7/11.
40 grams of mixture 1 contains 6*40/15=16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper
60 grams of mixture 2 contains 7*60/18=77/3 grams of zinc and 110/3 grams of copper
Thus, ratio =(16+77/3)/(24+110/3) =59/91

","  Thought: To find when the two balls will be at the same starting point again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time taken by ball A to make one full rotation and the time taken by ball B to make one full rotation.

Let's first find the time taken by ball A to make one full rotation:

2 full rotations = 2 x 26 minutes = 52 minutes

Now, let's find the time taken by ball B to make one full rotation:

5 full rotations = 5 x 35 minutes = 175 minutes

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 52 minutes and 175 minutes:

LCM(52, 175) = 385 minutes

So, the two balls will be at the same starting point again in 385 minutes.

Action: Answer(""B"")","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

Question: If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?

Let's analyze the given information:

* 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag the first time, and 1 of them was black.
* The percentage of black marbles in the first pull was 1/20 = 0.05.
* Then, 20 more marbles were pulled out, including 1 black marble.
* The percentage of black marbles in the second pull was 1/20 = 0.05 again.

Now, we need to find the total number of marbles in the bag. Let's use the information given in the question:

* The total number of marbles in the bag is 20 + 20 = 40 marbles.

So, the total number of marbles in the bag currently is:

We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the distance between A and B is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles

Now, we are told that Kevin turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, the time it took him to return to A is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 90 mph = 2.33 hours

We are also given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, we can set up the following equation:

70 miles + 3 hours = x miles + 3 hours (where x is the distance between A and B)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 280 miles

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 280 miles.

The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11. So, we can divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem.

Let's say the smaller integer is x. Then, the larger integer is 3x.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x is 7700.

3x × x = 7700

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3:

x × x = 23100

Now, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2:

x = 11550

","  Thought: To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to use the information that 30 of the books are hardcover and 20 are fiction.

Let's assume that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is x.

We know that the total number of books is 45, so the number of hardcover books plus the number of fiction books must be less than or equal to 45.

So, the equation is: 30 + x = 45

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 15.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Total Books = 45
Hard Cover = 30
Non hardcover = 15
Fiction = 20
Non-Fiction = 25
Maximum number of Hardcover fiction will be 20( Assuming All the Fiction Books are Hard Cover )

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5:02 AM. Therefore, the time difference between the two services is:

5:02 AM - 5:00 AM = 2 minutes

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the man catching the first train. Since the main line service starts at 5 o'clock, the man has a 50% chance of catching the first train if he arrives at the station at 5 o'clock.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is:

0.5 (50%)

","  Great, let's solve this problem!

We know that the two cars start at opposite ends of a 50-mile highway, and they are traveling at different speeds. The car traveling at 12 mph will cover 12 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is constant. The car traveling at 13 mph will cover 13 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is also constant.

To find the time it takes for the cars to meet, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

For the car traveling at 12 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:

Time = 50 miles / 12 mph = 4.17 hours (Answer: B)

For the car traveling at 13 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:

We know that the yard is rectangular, and one side is 100 feet wide. The total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet.

So, we can set up the following equation:

Area = Length x Width

Where Length is the other side of the yard.

We know the width of the other side is 100 feet, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

3000 = Length x 100

Let's analyze the expression for x:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Let's simplify the expression:

x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

We can see that the expression is always positive, since the numerator and denominator are always positive.

Now, let's check the values of x for different values of n:

* When n = 36, x = 48 / 42 = 1.14
* When n = 42, x = 64 / 46 = 1.41

","  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!

We know that the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it will order:

Sunday papers = 2 x (total papers per week - Sunday papers)
= 2 x (7 - 4)
= 2 x 3
= 6 papers on Sunday

Now, we know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. So, the total cost of newspapers for the week is:

Total cost = Number of papers x Cost per paper
= 6 x $4
= $24

Now, we can find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday:

Monday papers = Total cost / Cost per paper
= $24 / $1
= 24 papers on Monday

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 30.","Number of paper bought on monday = x
# of paper bought on sunday = 2x

Let's consider the letters of the alphabet as A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each letter can be used once or twice, so there are 5 letters in total.

Now, let's count the number of possible combinations of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers:

* AA: 2 combinations (A and B, A and E)
* AB: 3 combinations (A and B, A and D, A and F)
* AC: 3 combinations (A and C, A and D, A and E)

The probability of an event A occurring given that event B has occurred is denoted as P(A/B).

We are given that A and B are independent events, so we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We are also given the probabilities of A and B occurring:

P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8

Now, we need to find the probability of both events A and B occurring together. We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16

Now, we can plug this value into the formula for conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2

So, the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is 0.2.
