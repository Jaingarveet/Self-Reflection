- O is performed either first or fifth.
- P is performed at some time before S.
- At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
- The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
Now, we can use the given conditions to make some deductions:
- If O is performed first, then F and S must be performed after R, and T must be performed immediately before F. This means that P cannot be performed second, because it would have to be performed before F, which is not possible.
- If O is performed fifth, then F and S must be performed before R, and T must be performed immediately after R. This means that P cannot be performed sixth, because it would have to be performed after R, which is not possible.
Therefore, the only possible answer is D: P cannot be performed sixth.",,D,E,0,463,369,832,

Choices:
  A: fuel, machinery, textiles
  B: grain, machinery, fuel

","Choices:
  A: fuel, machinery, textiles
  B: grain, machinery, fuel
  C: machinery, livestock, fuel
  D: machinery, textiles, fuel
  E: machinery, textiles, produce
","Thought:
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, grain cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, livestock cannot be in bay 5 or 6.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, produce cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, textiles cannot be in bay 1 or 6.
From the above deductions, we can conclude that machinery must be in bay 1 or 2.
If machinery is in bay 1, then fuel must be in bay 3 and textiles must be in bay 4. This leaves grain for bay 6 and produce for bay 5.
If machinery is in bay 2, then fuel must be in bay 1 and textiles must be in bay 3. This leaves grain for bay 6 and produce for bay 5.
