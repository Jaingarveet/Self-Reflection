This question is asking for a similarity between a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum. 
A small, solid sample of aluminum has a definite shape and a definite volume.
A large, liquid sample of aluminum has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container.
Therefore, the only similarity between the two samples is that they both have a definite volume.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The previous answer was incorrect because it assumed that the predator would only prey on one type of sheep. However, the question states that the predator is new and does not specify which type of sheep it would prefer to prey on. Therefore, it is logical to assume that both types of sheep are equally vulnerable to the predator. 
If both types of sheep are equally vulnerable, then the population of both types of sheep will decrease. However, since the sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, they may have a slightly better chance of surviving the predator. Therefore, the decrease in the population of sheep with light wool will most likely occur first.
