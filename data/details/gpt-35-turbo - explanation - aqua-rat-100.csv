The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid is √(3² + 4² + 15²) = √250.
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the square root of two times the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diameter of the sphere is 2√250 = 10√10.

","Thought:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each person in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Then, Mr.Black works for 6 days and completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
So, the total work completed is 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 of the work.
The remaining work is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.
Let's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.
Then, (2/3)/x = 1/12
Solving for x, we get x = 8.
Action: Answer(""B"")","let x is amount of work to be done to paint one house.
So Brown's one day work is x/6, black's can do x/8 work in
one day and blue is x/12.
Total houses is 3, so tatal work to be done is 3x.
3x= 8*(x/6) + 6*(x/8) + y*(x/12)

During the entire 40 seconds, the space shuttle travels 700 + 87.5 = 787.5 m.

Let's use the ratio of boys to girls to find the number of boys and girls in the group.
If the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, then the total ratio is 4+3 = 7.
Let's assume that the same number of boys and girls joined the group, so the number of boys and girls increased by the same amount.
Let's call that amount ""x"".
So, the new number of boys is 64 + x and the new number of girls is 40 + x.
We can set up the equation: 
4/7 = (64 + x) / (40 + x)
Solving for x:
4(40 + x) = 7(64 + x)
160 + 4x = 448 + 7x
160 - 448 = 7x - 4x
-288 = 3x
x = -96
We can't have a negative number of new members, so we made a mistake somewhere.
Let's try the answer choices:
If x = 8, then the new number of boys is 72 and the new number of girls is 48.
The total number of members is 72 + 48 = 120.
Let's check the ratio of boys to girls:
72/48 = 3/2

88/64 = 11/8

If x = 32, then the new number of boys is 96 and the new number of girls is 72.
The total number of members is 96 + 72 = 168.

Then, we can write the following equations:
x/R1 + y/R2 = [REDACTED] (Total time taken to make x + y toys)
x + y = 35 (Total number of toys made)
Let's solve these equations to find the value of y.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

The inner surface of the hollow part of the cube is made up of 3 layers of 3x3 smaller cubes each, for a total of 27 smaller cubes.
So, the total number of smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 125 - 75 - 27 = 23.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"") [The correct answer is not one of the given choices. The correct answer is 23.]","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

","Thought:
Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"". 
We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. 
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B ""t1"", and the time it took him to drive from B to A ""t2"". 
We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. 
This means that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B. 
Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can set up two equations: d = 70t1 and d = 90t2. 
We can also set up a third equation using the fact that at time (t1 + t2 - 3), Kevin was 70 miles away from B: 
d - 70 = 90(t1 + t2 - 3). 
Now we have three equations and three unknowns (d, t1, and t2), which we can solve for. 
Simplifying the third equation, we get d - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. 
Substituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: 
70t1 - 70 = 90t1 + 90t2 - 270. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
20t1 - 90t2 = 200. 
We also know that t1 + t2 = (total time of trip) - 3. 
Let's call the total time of the trip ""T"". 
We know that distance = rate x time, so we can set up another equation: 
d = 70t1 + 90t2. 
Substituting d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into this equation, we get: 
d = 70t1 + 90t2 = 70t1 + 70t2 + 20t2 = 70(t1 + t2) + 20t2 = 70(T - 3) + 20t2. 
Now we have four equations and four unknowns (d, t1, t2, and T), which we can solve for. 
Simplifying the last equation, we get: 
d = 70(T - 3) + 20t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. 
Substituting this into the second equation (d = 90t2), we get: 
90t2 = 70T - 210 + 20t2. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
70t2 = 70T - 210. 
Substituting this into the first equation (20t1 - 90t2 = 200), we get: 
20t1 - (70T - 210) = 200. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
20t1 - 70T + 210 = 200. 
Subtracting 210 from both sides, we get: 
20t1 - 70T = -10. 
Dividing both sides by 10, we get: 
2t1 - 7T = -1. 
We also know that t1 + t2 = T - 3, so we can substitute t2 = T - 3 - t1 into the equation 90t2 = 70T - 210 to get: 
90(T - 3 - t1) = 70T - 210. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
90T - 270 - 90t1 = 70T - 210. 
Subtracting 70T from both sides, we get: 
20T - 270 - 90t1 = -210. 
Adding 270 to both sides, we get: 
20T - 90t1 = 60. 
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 
40T - 180t1 = 120. 
Now we have two equations and two unknowns (2t1 - 7T = -1 and 40T - 180t1 = 120), which we can solve for. 
Multiplying the first equation by 20, we get: 
40t1 - 140T = -20. 
Adding this to the second equation (40T - 180t1 = 120), we get: 
-40t1 = 100. 
Dividing both sides by -40, we get: 
t1 = -2.5. 
Substituting this into the equation 2t1 - 7T = -1, we get: 
2(-2.5) - 7T = -1. 
Simplifying this equation, we get: 
-5 - 7T = -1. 
Adding 5 to both sides, we get: 
-7T = 4. 
Dividing both sides by -7, we get: 
T = -4/7. 
This is a negative value, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's first calculate the ratio of investments of A, B, and C.
A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months, and C invested for x months.
So, the ratio of their investments will be (40,000 x 12) : (60,000 x 10) : (120,000 x x) = 4:6:3x
Let's assume the total profit is divided into 13 parts (4+6+3x).
So, C's share will be 3x/13 of the total profit.
We know that C's share is Rs.150,000.
So, 3x/13 = 150,000
Solving for x, we get x = 65/3 months.
C joined after B, so the time difference between their joining will be (65/3 - 2) months.

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
