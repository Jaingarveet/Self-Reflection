Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: $v=h+k-16 t$

  B: $v=\frac{h-k+16}{t}$
  C: $v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$
  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
","Thought:
To solve for $v$, we need to isolate it in the given equation.
Action: 
Rearranging the given equation, we get:
$$h=k+v t-16 t^{2}$$
$$16 t^{2}-v t+(h-k)=0$$
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
$$t=\frac{-(-v)\pm \sqrt{(-v)^{2}-4(16)(h-k)}}{2(16)}$$
Simplifying the expression under the square root:
$$(-v)^{2}-4(16)(h-k)=v^{2}-1024h+1024k$$
Substituting the value of $t$ in the original equation:
$$h=k+v\left(\frac{-v\pm \sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}\right)$$
Simplifying the expression inside the parenthesis:
$$\frac{-v\pm \sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}=\frac{1}{v}\left(-\frac{v^{2}}{32}\pm \frac{\sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}}{32}\right)$$
Substituting this value of $t$ in the equation derived from the original equation:
$$h=k-\frac{v^{2}}{32}\pm \frac{v}{32}\sqrt{v^{2}-1024h+1024k}$$
Simplifying the expression inside the square root:
$$v^{4}-64(v^{2})(h-k)+1024(h-k)^{2}=v^{4}-64hv^{2}+1024k^{2}$$
Simplifying the equation:
$$64hv^{2}=1024k^{2}+64(k-h)(h-k)$$
$$v^{2}=\frac{1024k^{2}+64(k-h)(h-k)}{64h}$$
$$v^{2}=16k^{2}+\frac{(h-k)(k-h)}{h}$$
Taking the square root of both sides:
$$v=\sqrt{16k^{2}+\frac{(h-k)(k-h)}{h}}$$
Simplifying the expression:
$$v=\sqrt{16k^{2}+\frac{h^{2}-2hk+k^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{16k^{2}h+h^{2}-2hk+k^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\sqrt{\frac{(4h-k)^{2}}{h}}$$
$$v=\frac{4h-k}{\sqrt{h}}$$
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Starting with the original equation, $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, in order to get $v$ in terms of the other variables, $-16 t^{2}$ and $k$ need to be subtracted from each side. This yields $v t=h+16 t^{2}-k$, which when divided by $t$ will give $v$ in terms of the other variables. However, the equation $v=\frac{h+16 t^{2}-k}{t}$ is not one of the options, so the right side needs to be further simplified. Another way to write the previous equation is $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+\frac{16 t^{2}}{t}$, which can be simplified to $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$.

We can use the given table to find the slope of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.
The slope of a linear relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$ is given by $\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$.
Action: 
The change in $y$ when $x$ increases from $a$ to $3a$ is $-a-0=-a$.
The change in $x$ when $x$ increases from $a$ to $3a$ is $3a-a=2a$.
So, the slope of the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $\frac{-a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
The equation of a line with slope $m$ that passes through a point $(x_1,y_1)$ is given by $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$.
Using the point $(a,0)$ and the slope $-\frac{1}{2}$, we get $y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$, which simplifies to $x+2y=2a$.
Multiplying both sides by $\frac{5}{2}$, we get $x+2y=5a$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ x+2 y=5 a}$.","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$.

","Thought:
The weight of an object on a planet can be found using the formula $W=mg$.
We need to find the planet where the weight of the object is approximately 170 newtons.
We know that the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons.
We can use the formula $W=mg$ to find the value of $g$ on each planet.
Then, we can use the formula again to find the mass of the object on each planet.
Finally, we can check which planet gives a weight of approximately 170 newtons.
Action: 
The weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons.
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
So, the mass of the object on Earth is $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{150}{9.8}\approx 15.31$ kg.
For each planet, we can find the mass of the object using the formula $W=mg$.
For Venus, $g=8.9$ $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, so $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{170}{8.9}\approx 19.10$ kg.
For Saturn, $g=11.1$ $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, so $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{170}{11.1}\approx 15.32$ kg.
For Uranus, $g=10.7$ $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, so $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{170}{10.7}\approx 15.89$ kg.
For Neptune, $g=14.1$ $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, so $m=\frac{W}{g}=\frac{170}{14.1}\approx 12.06$ kg.
The mass of the object on Saturn is approximately 15.32 kg, which is the same as the mass of the object on Earth.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on Saturn.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$. Thus, for an object with a weight of 150 newtons, the formula $W=m g$ becomes $150=m(9.8)$, which shows that the mass of an object with a weight of 150 newtons on Earth is about 15.3 kilograms. Substituting this mass into the formula $W=m g$ and now using the weight of 170 newtons gives $170=15.3 g$, which shows that the second planet's acceleration due to gravity is about $11.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$. According to the table, this value for the acceleration due to gravity holds on Saturn.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect.

$S(P+10)-S(P)=\frac{1}{2}(P+10)+40-\frac{1}{2}P-40= \frac{1}{2}(10)=5$
Answer: Answer(""B"") The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. The quantity of the product supplied to the market is given by the function $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$. If the price $P$ of the product increases by $\$ 10$, the effect on the quantity of the product supplied can be determined by substituting $P+10$ for $P$ in the function $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$. This gives $S(P+10)=\frac{1}{2}(P+10)+40=\frac{1}{2} P+45$, which shows that $S(P+10)=S(P)+5$. Therefore, the quantity supplied to the market will increase by 5 units when the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$.Alternatively, look at the coefficient of $P$ in the linear function $S$. This is the slope of the graph of the function, where $P$ is on the horizontal axis and $S(P)$ is on the vertical axis. Since the slope is $\frac{1}{2}$, for every increase of 1 in $P$, there will be an increase of $\frac{1}{2}$ in $S(P)$, and therefore, an increase of 10 in $P$ will yield an increase of 5 in $S(P)$.Choice $A$ is incorrect. If the quantity supplied decreases as the price of the product increases, the function $S(P)$ would be decreasing, but $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$ is an increasing function.

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second equation, we get $ax+2y=4$ and $-6x+4y=12$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $-3x+2y=6$ which is the same as $-3x+y=6$.
Comparing this equation with the first equation, we see that they are the same.
This means that the two equations represent the same line and have infinitely many solutions.
For the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.
This happens when the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.
So, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $\frac{-3}{a} \neq \frac{2}{4}$.
Simplifying, we get $-6 \neq a$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $a x+2 y=4$ are represented by the expression $-\frac{a}{2}$ and the point $(0,2)$, respectively. The value of $a$ can be found by setting the two slopes equal to each other, which gives $-\frac{a}{2}=3$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by -2 gives $a=-6$. When $a=-6$, the lines are parallel and have different $y$-intercepts.

$ab=15$ and $a+b=8$ implies $a=3$ and $b=5$ or $a=5$ and $b=3$.
Substituting these values in $7a+2b=c$, we get $c=29$ or $c=11$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 11 and 29. Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

Therefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+16.94$.

Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by $a x-2$ gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x(a x-2)-3(a x-2)-53$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 a x^{2}+19 x+107$
Rearranging the terms gives $8 a x^{2}+x(19-25)+47-107=0$
Simplifying the left-hand side gives $8 a x^{2}-6 x-60=0$
Dividing both sides by 2 gives $4 a x^{2}-3 x-30=0$
We know that this equation is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
This means that the denominator $a x-2$ cannot be equal to zero, so $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by $a x-2$.
Doing so gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x^{2}-3(a x-2)-53$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives $24 x^{2}+25 x-47=-8 x^{2}-3 a x+47$
Rearranging the terms gives $8 x^{2}+3 a x-94=0$
We know that this equation is true for all values of $x \neq \frac{2}{a}$.
This means that the discriminant of the equation must be non-negative.
Therefore, $(3 a)^{2}-4(8)(-94) \geq 0$
Simplifying the left-hand side gives $9 a^{2}+3008 \geq 0$
This inequality is true for all values of $a$ except $a=0$.
Therefore, $a$ cannot be equal to zero.
The only answer choice that satisfies both conditions is $a=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$.","Choice B is correct. Since $24 x^{2}+25 x-47$ divided by $a x-2$ is equal to $-8 x-3$ with remainder -53 , it is true that $(-8 x-3)(a x-2)-53=$ $24 x^{2}+25 x-47$. (This can be seen by multiplying each side of the given equation by $a x-2)$. This can be rewritten as $-8 a x^{2}+16 x-3 a x+6-53=$ $24 x^{2}+25 x-47$. Since the coefficients of the $x^{2}$-term have to be equal on both sides of the equation, $-8 a=24$, or $a=-3$.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect and may be the result of either a conceptual misunderstanding or a computational error when trying to solve for the value of $a$.",,B,0,334,461,795,

Let's start by finding the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students. Then, we can use the given ratios to find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students. Finally, we can use the total number of right-handed students and the number of right-handed female students to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.
Let's denote the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students as $f$ and $m$, respectively. Then, we have:
$f + m = 18$ (total number of left-handed students)
$9m = 122 - f$ (number of right-handed male students)
$5f = 122 - 9m$ (number of right-handed female students)
Solving for $f$ and $m$, we get:
$f = \frac{122}{14}, m = \frac{40}{7}$
Now, we can find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students:
$5f = \frac{610}{14}$
$9m = \frac{360}{7}$
The total number of right-handed students is:
$\frac{610}{14} + \frac{360}{7} = \frac{1220}{7}$
Therefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:
$\frac{\frac{610}{14}}{\frac{1220}{7}} = \frac{35}{98} \approx 0.357$
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is correct. Let $x$ be the number of left-handed female students and let $y$ be the number of left-handed male students.

If Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, then the number of pears produced by Type B trees is 20% less than Type A trees.
Let's use the formula: 
percent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%
Action: Answer(""120"")
We can set up the equation as follows:
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1
20 = (144 - x) / 1.44
20 x 1.44 = 144 - x

x = 144 - 28.8
x = 115.2

The quadratic equation $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4=0$ can be factored as $(x+1)(x+4)=0$.

The distance between the $x$-intercepts is $|-1-(-4)|=3$.
Answer: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The $x$-intercepts of the graph of $f(x)=x^{2}+5 x+4$ are the points $(x, f(x))$ on the graph where $f(x)=0$.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. In the equation $h=3 a+28.6$, if $a$, the age of the boy, increases by 1 , then $h$ becomes $h=3(a+1)+28.6=3 a+3+28.6=$ $(3 a+28.6)+3$. Therefore, the model estimates that the boy's height increases by 3 inches each year.Alternatively: The height, $h$, is a linear function of the age, $a$, of the boy. The coefficient 3 can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function; in this case, the rate of change can be described as a change of 3 inches in height for every additional year in age.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and are likely the result of dividing 28.6 by 5,3 , and 2 , respectively.

Since both points of intersection have a $y$-coordinate of 25 , it follows that the two points are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$. Since these points lie on the horizontal line $y=25$, the distance between these points is the positive difference of the $x$-coordinates: $16-6=10$.Alternatively, since a translation is a rigid motion, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ would be the same as the distance between the points of intersection of the line $y=25$ and the parabola $y=x^{2}$.

Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",N,B,0,319,165,484,

Substitute $-1$ for $x$ in the function $f(x)$.
Action: Answer(""1"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The value of $f(-1)$ can be found by substituting-1 for $x$ in the given function $f(x)=\frac{x+3}{2}$, which yields $f(-1)=\frac{-1+3}{2}$.Rewriting the numerator by adding -1 and 3 yields $\frac{2}{2}$, which equals 1 .Therefore, $f(-1)=1$.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may result from miscalculating the value of $\frac{-1+3}{2}$ as $\frac{-4}{2}$, or -2 . Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from misinterpreting the value of $x$ as the value of $f(-1)$.

","Thought:
We need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.
We can solve for $t$ by setting $a$ equal to 1,000 and solving for $t$.
Action: 
Substitute $a=1,000$ into the formula and solve for $t$:
\begin{aligned} 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ -52 &=1.08 t \\ t &\approx-48.15 \end{aligned}
The temperature closest to $-48.15$ is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so the answer is (B). Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. The air temperature at which the speed of a sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second can be found by substituting 1,000 for $a$ and then solving for $t$ in the given formula. Substituting 1,000 for $a$ in the equation $a=1,052+1.08$ t gives $1,000=1,052+1.08 t$. Subtracting 1,052 from both sides of the equation $1,000=1,052+1.08 t$ and then dividing both sides of the equation by 1.08 yields$t=\frac{-52}{1.08} \approx-48.15$. Of the choices given, $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ is closest to $-48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect and might arise from errors made when substituting 1,000 for $a$ or solving for $t$ in the equation $a=1,052+1.08 t$ or in rounding the result to the nearest integer. For example, choice $\mathrm{C}$ could be the result of rounding -48.15 to -49 instead of -48 .",B,B,1,407,146,553,
