","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, using the advice from the reflection:
1) We need to consider whether the order of letters in a pair matters. The question states that the order does not matter, so we will be using combinations, not permutations.
2) Let's break it down into cases based on the number of letters used:
   Case 1: Using all single letter codes
   - This would require 10 letters to uniquely code all 10 types of books.
   Case 2: Using all pairs of letters
   - With n letters, we can create nC2 = n(n-1)/2 unique unordered pairs.
   - We need at least 10 unique pairs. Let's solve for n:
     n(n-1)/2 ≥ 10
     n(n-1) ≥ 20
     n^2 - n - 20 ≥ 0
     (n - 5)(n + 4) ≥ 0
     Since n is a positive integer, n ≥ 5
   - So using all pairs, we would need at least 5 letters.
   Case 3: Using a mix of single letters and pairs
   - Suppose we use k single letters and pairs from the remaining n-k letters.
   - The total number of unique codes would be k + (n-k)(n-k-1)/2
   - We want this to be at least 10. Let's try some values:
     * If k = 1, then 1 + (n-1)(n-2)/2 ≥ 10. This requires n ≥ 6.
     * If k = 2, then 2 + (n-2)(n-3)/2 ≥ 10. This requires n ≥ 5.
     * If k = 3, then 3 + (n-3)(n-4)/2 ≥ 10. This requires n ≥ 5.
   - In all these cases, we need at least 5 letters.
3) Checking our work:
   - With 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E), we can create 5 single letter codes (A, B, C, D, E) and 10 pair codes (AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE).
   - This gives us a total of 15 unique codes, which is more than the 10 we need.
Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 5.
Action: Answer(""C"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. 
2. It takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point at this speed.
3. We need to find the length of the shuttle. Let's call this length L.
To find the length, we can use the formula:
* Speed = Distance / Time
* Rearranging, Distance = Speed × Time
We know the time it takes the shuttle to pass a point is 5 seconds. 
To get the speed, we can use the information about the 700m height:
* Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
Now plugging into the distance formula:
* Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s 
* Distance = 87.5 meters

1. Understand the given information:
   * The company produces 420 components per month
   * The production cost per component is $110
   * The company wants a minimum yearly profit of $626,400
2. Calculate the yearly production:
   * Monthly production = 420 components
   * Yearly production = 420 × 12 = 5,040 components
3. Calculate the yearly production cost:
   * Production cost per component = $110
   * Yearly production cost = 5,040 × $110 = $554,400
4. Calculate the minimum yearly revenue needed to achieve the desired profit:
   * Minimum yearly profit = $626,400
   * Minimum yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Minimum yearly profit
   * Minimum yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
5. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:
   * Minimum yearly revenue = $1,180,800
   * Yearly production = 5,040 components
   * Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040 = $234.29
6. Compare the calculated minimum selling price to the given options:
   * The calculated price of $234.29 is not an exact match for any option
   * The nearest option that guarantees the desired yearly profit is $240

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.
2. At 45° angle of elevation:
   tan(45°) = h/x
   1 = h/x
   x = h
3. After 10 minutes at 60° angle of elevation:
   tan(60°) = h/(x-d), where d is distance traveled in 10 min
   √3 = h/(x-d)
   √3(x-d) = h
   √3x - √3d = h
   
4. From (2), h = x
   Substituting in (3):
   √3x - √3d = x
   √3x - x = √3d
   x(√3 - 1) = √3d
   x = √3d/(√3 - 1)
5. Let the remaining time to reach the tower be t.
   Then, x = speed * t
        √3d/(√3 - 1) = d/10 * t
        10√3/(√3 - 1) = t
6. Simplify:
   10√3/(√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)
   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))
   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3 - 1)

   = 5√3(√3 + 1)
   = 5(3 + √3)
   = 15 + 5√3
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 + 5√3 minutes more.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

   Area of square = side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2
2. Two semicircles are cut out from opposite sides of the square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So the radius of each semicircle is 10 cm.
3. The area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle. The area of a circle is πr^2.

   - Sachin's current batting average is 51.
   - In the final match, he scores 78 runs.
   - After the final, his batting average becomes 54.
2. We can set up an equation based on the definition of batting average:
   - Batting average = Total runs scored / Number of matches played
   - So, 51 = Total runs before final / x
   - And, 54 = (Total runs before final + 78) / (x + 1)

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's assign variables:
   Let Arjun's money be x and Sajal's money be y.
2. From the given conditions, we can write two equations:
   - If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
     Equation 1: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
   - If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
     Equation 2: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
3. Simplify Equation 1:
   y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
   y + 30 = 2x - 60
   y = 2x - 90
4. Substitute y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   x + 10 = 3((2x - 90) - 10)
   x + 10 = 3(2x - 100)
   x + 10 = 6x - 300
5. Solve for x:
   x + 10 = 6x - 300
   -5x = -310
   x = 62
6. Substitute x = 62 into y = 2x - 90:
   y = 2(62) - 90
   y = 124 - 90
   y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Suppose Arun has $X and Sajal has $Y. then,
2(x-30)= y+30 => 2x-y =90 …(i)

Solving (i) and (ii), we get x =62 and y =34.
Arun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. Let's call this his normal speed.
2. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current's speed is the difference between his normal speed and his speed against the current. 
   Current speed = Normal speed - Speed against current
                 = 4 kmph - 2 kmph 
                 = 2 kmph
3. When rowing along the current, the man's speed will be his normal speed plus the current's speed.
   Speed along current = Normal speed + Current speed

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. We have a circle with points A, B, C, D in order around the circumference.
2. Minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means:
   - Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
   - Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°
3. We are also told that minor arc BD is 150°. 
4. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to visualize the circle:
   - Going clockwise from A to D, we have minor arc AB (80°) plus minor arc BD (150°).
   - So minor arc AD = 80° + 150° = 230°
5. However, 230° is more than half the circle. The question asks for the minor arc between A and D.
   - In a circle, the sum of a minor arc and major arc between the same two points is always 360°.
   - So the minor arc AD must be: 360° - 230° = 130°
6. Looking at the answer choices, 130° corresponds to choice B.
Action: Answer(""B"")","B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees. Now , we have arc BD = 150, therefore CD = 70.

   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes
   - We want to find how many pita breads equal 2 baguettes
2. Express rolls in terms of pita breads:
   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls
   - 1 roll = 6/2 = 3 pita breads
3. Express baguettes in terms of rolls:
   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes 
   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls
4. Express 2 baguettes in terms of rolls:
   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls
   - 2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5) = 6/5 rolls
5. Express 2 baguettes in terms of pita breads:
   - 1 roll = 3 pita breads

1. The school has more than 501 students. So the possible number of students is 502 or greater.
2. 20% of the students took physics. This means the number of physics students must be a whole number.
3. 28% of the students took math. Again, this must be a whole number of students. 
4. Importantly, the percentages only account for 20% + 28% = 48% of the students. The remaining 52% are unaccounted for.
5. This means it's possible that the remaining 52% of students took neither physics nor math. The question doesn't exclude this possibility.
6. So let's start with the smallest possible number of students, 502, and see if it works:
   - 20% of 502 is 100.4, which is not a whole number. So 502 doesn't work.
   - 28% of 502 is 140.56, also not a whole number.
7. Let's try the next number, 503:
   - 20% of 503 is 100.6, not a whole number.
   - 28% of 503 is 140.84, not a whole number.
8. We could keep going, but notice that for any number of students, 20% and 28% will never both be whole numbers simultaneously. This is because 20% and 28% are not factors of 100%.

1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be b. Then the length will be 4b + 1.
2. We know the area of the rectangle is 150 sq m. Using the formula for area of a rectangle:
   Area = length × breadth
   150 = (4b + 1) × b
   150 = 4b^2 + b
3. Solve the quadratic equation:
   4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
   4b^2 + b - 150 = 0
   (4b - 15)(b + 10) = 0
   b = 15/4 or b = -10 (reject as breadth can't be negative)
