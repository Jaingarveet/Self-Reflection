Choices:
  A: They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.
  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.

  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Passage 1 argues that the Constitution, which allows for both free states and slave states, is not contrary to the law of God and can stand. The author says the country has grown and prospered under this Constitution.
2. The author states: ""It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors."" This suggests the Constitution provides a good basic structure allowing states to decide the slavery issue for themselves.
3. The passage also notes that as a young, growing nation, the U.S. will need to ""expand and acquire new territory from time to time."" This implies the Constitution anticipated westward expansion of the Union. 
4. The author does not suggest the Constitution included no means for reconciling free state vs slave state differences, that slavery was seen as necessary for economic growth, or that the Constitution needs to be changed.
5. Therefore, the best answer is C - the Constitution ""provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed."" It anticipated expansion and allowed states to decide the slavery question individually.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is retry because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is retry because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1318,271,1589,

Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Akira comes to see Chie directly, without following the traditional process of using a go-between. This suggests he is worried about timing and the urgency of his request.
2. When Akira speaks to Chie, the passage notes ""His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face."" This shows he is trying to be respectful and polite, likely to avoid seeming inappropriate.
3. Akira says ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal."" This directly states his concern that Chie will view his direct approach and proposal as unseemly or inappropriate.
4. There is no strong evidence that Akira is primarily concerned about Chie mistaking his earnestness for immaturity, seeing his visit as an imposition, or underestimating his sincerity. His words and actions point most clearly to a fear of appearing inappropriate.
Therefore, the best answer is that Akira most fears Chie will consider his proposal inappropriate.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is retry because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",A,A,1,1557,253,1810,

  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The narrator notices many details about her father's shop, wanting to remember everything to tell GaoLing later to ""tease out her envy"". This shows the narrator is very observant of her surroundings.
2. She notices the clean, polished floors with no dirty footprints, the shiny unbroken glass of the display cases, and how much nicer the silk-wrapped boxes look compared to in the village studio. Again, this highlights her attention to the details of her immediate environment.
3. She carefully listens to and watches her father's sales pitch to the customer, noting the specific imagery he uses to describe each inkstick. This further demonstrates her focus on the details of what's happening around her in the moment.
4. She recalls Precious Auntie's life lessons about ink-making while in the shop, showing how the setting is triggering her to reflect on relevant memories, another sign of being tuned in to her current surroundings.
5. While she is described as speaking in a ""shy voice"" to Big Uncle, shyness around unfamiliar people does not seem to be a major characteristic emphasized overall. The passage focuses much more on her keen observations.
Therefore, the best answer is B - the narrator is portrayed as being highly attuned to her immediate surroundings throughout the passage.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is retry because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is retry because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is retry because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",B,A,0,1316,312,1628,

","Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The first paragraph introduces Akira's untraditional approach to asking for Chie's daughter's hand in marriage. It questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if Akira had followed tradition.
2. The paragraph does not go into detail describing the culture or tradition itself. So A is not the best answer.
3. While it notes Akira broke tradition, the tone is more questioning than directly criticizing. So B doesn't seem to fit best either.
4. The paragraph is not really analyzing Chie's reaction, as her reaction is not described in detail here. So D is out.
5. The key phrase seems to be ""Had he followed form...would Chie have been more receptive?"" This is posing a question about how Chie would have reacted if Akira had followed tradition. 
Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion - the suggestion being that Chie may have responded more positively if Akira had taken the traditional approach.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is retry because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is retry because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is retry because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1526,245,1771,
