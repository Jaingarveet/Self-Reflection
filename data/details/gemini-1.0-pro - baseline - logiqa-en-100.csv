The passage states that the price increase in China exceeded the interest rate of bank deposits.
This means that people could earn more money by investing their money elsewhere, rather than keeping it in the bank.
The passage also states that the proportion of time deposits in all deposits continued to decline.
This means that people were moving their money out of time deposits, which are a type of savings account that earns interest.
The best explanation for the flow of most of the 100 billion yuan savings funds is that people were looking for better returns on their money.

The argument claims that the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law because it is a small property house and is not subject to registration.
Option A: This option weakens the argument because if the house has been tacitly approved by relevant departments, it may be considered legal even if it is a small property house.
Option B: This option strengthens the argument because it confirms that the house is a small property house, which is not protected by law.
Option C: This option strengthens the argument because it confirms that the house is built on rural collective land, which is not protected by law.
Option D: This option weakens the argument because it suggests that not all newly built houses in Hexi Village are small property houses, which means that the argument may not apply to all houses in the village.

  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
","Choices:
  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
  B: Before? G In? K After? N
  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
","Thought:
Let's analyze the conditions:
(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.
(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.
(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.
(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.
(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.
(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
Since H is in Team 2, condition (6) applies, and Q must be in the middle of Team 1. This eliminates options B and D.
Condition (3) states that L must be on Team 1. This eliminates option C.
Therefore, the only acceptable arrangement for Team 1 is:
**A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N**
