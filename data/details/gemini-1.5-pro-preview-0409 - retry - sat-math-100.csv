Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
","Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
","Thought:
To solve for x, we need to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.
This gives us: 4x = (x-3)^2
Expanding the right side, we get: 4x = x^2 - 6x + 9
Rearranging to set the equation to 0: x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation: (x-1)(x-9) = 0
Therefore, x = 1 or x = 9.
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Choice B is correct. Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$ yields $4 x=(x-3)^{2}$, or $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$. Applying the distributive property on the right-hand side of the equation $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$ yields $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$. Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$. Adding 9 to both sides of $0=x-9$ gives $x=9$. Substituting these values for $x$ into the given equation will determine whether they satisfy the equation. Substituting 1 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(1)}=1-3$, or $\sqrt{4}=-2$, which is false. Therefore, $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation. Substituting 9 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(9)}=9-3$ or $\sqrt{36}=6$, which is true. Therefore, $x=9$ satisfies the given equation.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ are retry because $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation: $\sqrt{4 x}$ represents the principal square root of $4 x$, which can't be negative. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry because $x=9$ does satisfy the given equation.",C,B,0,362,127,489,
