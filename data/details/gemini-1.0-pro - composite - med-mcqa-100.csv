These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care.

","Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration
  C: Weak acid and weak base combination
  D: easy to measure
","I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Thought:**
* **Pka is equal to Ph:** This is not the ideal condition for a buffer, as it would be at its maximum buffering capacity and unable to effectively resist changes in pH.
* **High concentration:** While a high concentration of bicarbonate ions is present in the blood, it is not the primary reason why it is an ideal buffer.
* **Weak acid and weak base combination:** This is a key characteristic of an effective buffer system. Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) act as a weak base, while carbonic acid (H2CO3) acts as a weak acid. This allows the buffer to resist changes in pH by accepting or donating hydrogen ions (H+).
* **Easy to measure:** While this may be a practical advantage, it is not the primary reason why bicarbonate is an ideal buffer.
**Action:** Answer(""C"") 
**Explanation:**
The combination of a weak acid (carbonic acid) and a weak base (bicarbonate ions) makes the bicarbonate buffer system ideal for regulating blood pH. This is because the weak acid and weak base can react with hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH-) to maintain a relatively stable pH within the physiological range. 
","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U. Satyanarayan 4th)Advantages of bicarbonate buffer system* It is present in very high concentration than other buffer system (26 to 28 millimole per littre )* Produces H2CO3 which is weak acid and volatile and CO2 is exhaled out* Hence it is a very good physiological buffer and acts as a front line defense.Disadvantages - As a chemical buffer, it is rather weak, pKa is further away from the physiological pH",C,B,0,361,269,630,

**Answer:**
Action: Answer(""D"") 
**Explanation:**
Subtle seizures are the most common type of seizure in newborns. These seizures are often difficult to detect because they may not involve明显的convulsions. Instead, they may manifest as brief episodes of staring, eye fluttering, or changes in breathing or muscle tone. 
","Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Neonatal seizures: Usual onset at 12-48 hours. Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

","Thought: 
The patient has recurrent aspirations but no change in voice. This suggests that the vagus nerve, which is responsible for both swallowing and voice, is not injured.
The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for taste sensation in the posterior third of the tongue and gag reflex. Injury to this nerve would not cause recurrent aspirations.
The SLN nerve is responsible for sensation to the skin of the ear and the external auditory canal. Injury to this nerve would not cause recurrent aspirations.
The RLN nerve is responsible for motor function of the larynx, including vocal cord movement. Injury to this nerve would cause hoarseness or loss of voice. Since the patient has no change in voice, the RLN nerve is not injured.

","Thought: 
Opisthotonus posture is a symptom of strychnine poisoning.
Strychnine is found in Strychnos nux vomica.
Action: Answer(""D"")","STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

**Thought:**
* Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it.
* Anteroposterior X-ray, lateral view X-ray, CT, and MRI are all imaging modalities that can be used to diagnose spondylolisthesis.
* Anteroposterior X-ray shows the front-to-back view of the spine.
* Lateral view X-ray shows the side view of the spine.
* CT scan provides detailed cross-sectional images of the spine.
* MRI scan provides detailed images of the soft tissues surrounding the spine.
**Analysis:**
* All of the imaging modalities listed can be useful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis.
* Anteroposterior X-ray and lateral view X-ray are the most basic imaging modalities and can be used to identify the presence of spondylolisthesis.
* CT scan can provide more detailed information about the bones and joints of the spine.
* MRI scan can provide more detailed information about the soft tissues surrounding the spine, such as the spinal cord and nerves.
**Conclusion:**
* All of the imaging modalities listed can be useful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis.
* The choice of imaging modality will depend on the individual patient and the severity of their condition.

Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
","Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
","I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Oligohydramnios:** This is a condition where there is too little amniotic fluid, which can cause the baby to be in an unstable lie. However, it is not the most likely cause in this case.
* **Placenta previa:** This is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, which can also cause the baby to be in an unstable lie. However, it is not the most likely cause in this case.
* **Pelvic tumor:** This is a tumor in the pelvis, which can take up space and cause the baby to be in an unstable lie. This is the most likely cause in this case.
* **Uterine anomalies:** These are abnormalities in the shape or size of the uterus, which can also cause the baby to be in an unstable lie. However, it is not the most likely cause in this case.
**Solution:**
The most likely cause of an unstable lie in a 34-week multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries is a pelvic tumor.
**Instructions:**
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider the following factors:
* The patient is a multigravida, which means she has had more than one pregnancy.
* The patient has had 2 previous normal deliveries, which means she has not had any problems with unstable lies in the past.
* The patient is at 34 weeks gestation, which means she is in the third trimester of pregnancy.
* The patient has an unstable lie, which means the baby is not in the head-down position.
Based on these factors, the most likely cause of the unstable lie is a pelvic tumor.
**Advice:**
To avoid making the same mistake again, I will need to pay more attention to the details of the question and consider all of the possible causes of an unstable lie. I will also need to be more careful about using keywords that are not relevant to the question.
