Following the step-by-step solution and considering the reflection on the previous error, let's analyze each option:
*   **Option A:** As identified in the reflection, this option violates both the minimum novel requirement and the rule about selecting the Russian play when both French plays are chosen. So, it's impossible.
*   **Option B:** This selection would include 1 Russian novel, 2 French novels (to satisfy the ""French novels ≥ Russian novels"" rule), and 2 French plays. This fulfills all requirements.

*   **B (H is sixth):** This allows for Q or Y to be seventh, satisfying all constraints. So, B is possible.
*   **C (Q is first):** This doesn't conflict with any rules as the constraint only affects S placement relative to Q, not vice versa. So, C is possible.
*   **D (S is second):** This would require Q to be third to satisfy ""S before Q only if Q is third"", but J is already third. So, D is not possible.
