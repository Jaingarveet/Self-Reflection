The passage also mentions that the despedida is a set convention, with the first and third lines being consistent across different corridos.

Solution:
The passage discusses the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. It highlights the use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, including the use of everyday images and ready-made lines, which serve to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also mentions that corridos have roots in eighteenth-century Spain.

The question asks which statement the author would most likely agree with. The correct answer is E: A corrido without a surviving despedida would lack an important marker of both its uniqueness and its generic continuity, as the passage mentions that the despedida is a clear marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity.

The author discusses how the narrative slips easily from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, and how this is analogous to the playing of a jazz band. The author also highlights how Morrison's use of language and narrative point of view serves to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.

The author discusses primary substances mainly to provide a contrast to secondary substances, which are the focus of the passage. By explaining that primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, the author helps the reader understand that secondary substances have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.

","Thought:
The author of passage A argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules. The plan described in passage B involves selectively enforcing the rule only against certain individuals to achieve a particular goal, which is an example of discretionary nonenforcement. However, the author of passage A would likely not agree that the plan described in passage B is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, as it targets only high-income neighborhoods and does not address the underlying issue of the loophole prohibiting debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city.

","Reflection:
Upon re-reading the question and the passage, I realized that the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is not that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, but rather that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.

Choice A is not a strong objection because it does not address the specific criticism that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.

Choice B is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Choice C is not a strong objection because it does not address the specific criticism that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.

Choice D is not relevant to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.

Choice E is not a strong objection because it does not address the specific criticism that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
