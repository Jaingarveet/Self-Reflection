The argument is about advertisers considering both economic benefits and ethical responsibilities.
Option A is not related to ethical responsibilities, but it is related to economic benefits.
Option B is about the benefits of the advertisers who switched to other publications, but it does not support the argument.
Option C is related to ethical responsibilities, but it does not support the argument.

  C: In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes.
  D: The online forum is a legal forum
","Thought:
The argument is that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating based on the statistical comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago. The evidence used to support the argument is that posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people have increased by 90%. Option B, which states that the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, could be an alternative explanation for the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. Option C, which states that some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes, is irrelevant to the argument. Option D, which states that the online forum is a legal forum, does not address the argument. Option A, which states that ""Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles."" Throughout the ages, is a general statement that does not address the argument. Therefore, option B is the answer because it weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. If the increase in the number of internet users is the main reason for the increase in such posts, then the social atmosphere may not be rapidly deteriorating.
