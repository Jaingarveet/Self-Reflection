","Choices:
  A: zero

","Thought:
The third solo is a traditional piece, so Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first two solos. 
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, so Wayne must perform a traditional piece in the third or fourth solo. 
Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, so if Wayne performs a traditional piece in the third solo, Zara must perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo. 
If Wayne performs a traditional piece in the fourth solo, Zara must perform a modern piece in the fourth solo. 
Therefore, Wayne must perform a traditional piece in either the third or fourth solo.

Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be included in the list.

Jiang does not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews, so Jiang cannot be included in the list.
Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian cannot be included in the list.

","Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to carefully consider the conditions and eliminate any assumptions or scenario errors.
If only one batch is made on Friday, then it must be the third batch of either oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies.
If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, C is not true.
If the third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. This satisfies all the conditions, so E could be true.
If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This violates the condition that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, A is not true.
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This satisfies all the conditions, so B could be true.
If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday.

  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
","Thought:
The condition states that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, then the website targets must be either 1 day or 3 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 3 days, and Solide's website target must be 1 day. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, and the other clients' voicemail targets must be 2 days or 3 days. 
Option A is incorrect because Image's website target cannot be shorter than Solide's website target because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

","Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, so I need to carefully review the information provided.
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock cannot be in bay 5 or 6.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so produce cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
Textiles is next to produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1 or 6.
From the above information, we can conclude that machinery must be in bay 1 or 2.
If machinery is in bay 1, then fuel must be in bay 3, and textiles must be in bay 6, which violates the rule that textiles is next to produce.
Therefore, machinery must be in bay 2, fuel must be in bay 1, and textiles must be in bay 5.
