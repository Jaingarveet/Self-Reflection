5. If some parts are neither cold nor humid (C), those parts would be suitable for cacti. This fits with the given information. So (C) could be true.
6. The information doesn't say it's impossible to raise cacti anywhere in the country (D), just that it's difficult in humid areas. So (D) is not necessarily true based on the given information.

","Let's break this down step-by-step:
The radio producer's argument follows this pattern:
1. We have two options: A (devote airtime to other genres) or B (stick with classical music only)
2. If we do B, there is a major risk (going out of business) 
3. We should not take that major risk
4. Therefore, we should do A
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This is the most similar. It presents two options (buy blinds or make curtains). It identifies a major downside to one option (blinds being very expensive). Implicitly, it suggests this downside should be avoided, leading to the conclusion of choosing the other option (make curtains).
B, C, D, E: These have some similarities in presenting options and downsides, but none of them have the clear pattern of 1) two options 2) one has a major risk 3) avoid that risk 4) do the other option.
Therefore, A is the best answer, as it most closely mirrors the radio producer's reasoning of choosing one option to avoid a major risk of the other option.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Mike is trying to justify using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. 
2. Mike seems to be relying on a general principle rather than the specifics of computer or bicycle use. The principle is that if someone has used another person's property without permission, it's okay for that person to use the first person's property without permission in return.
3. Looking at the answer choices, C and D both capture this general principle of reciprocity - that it's acceptable to treat others how they have treated you or others. 
4. Between C and D, D states the principle in more general terms - that it's permissible to treat people similarly to how they have treated others. This matches Mike's reasoning more closely than C, which is specific to using property without permission.
5. The other choices focus on other aspects like harm, truth-telling, or the blanket statement that using others' possessions without permission isn't always wrong. But none of those capture the core of Mike's justification.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the professor's argument are:
1) Checkers refused to accept coupons that Marty's issued, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them. 
2) Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied some of its potential customers.
3) Therefore, Checkers' motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume a general principle that connects Checkers' specific actions to the motive of wanting to hurt Marty's.
Looking at the choices:
A) This is too broad. A company could have other motives for refusing competitor coupons besides just wanting to hurt the competitor. It assumes hurting the competitor is the sole motive.
B) This looks promising. It states that if a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing their coupons, they will do so even when it costs them nothing and dissatisfies customers. This matches Checkers' behavior as described.
C) This just states that at least one company has behaved this way, but doesn't establish a general principle that would allow concluding Checkers' motive. It's too specific to another company.
D) This is about the consequences of accepting a competitor's coupons, not about the motives behind refusing them. It's not directly relevant.
E) This is the inverse of the professor's argument. The professor argues that since refusing the coupons did satisfy customers, the motive wasn't satisfying customers. This choice doesn't help establish the professor's conclusion.
Therefore, B is the best choice. It provides the missing assumption that connects Checkers' actions to the motive of wanting to hurt Marty's.

  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points from the judge's reasoning are:
1) The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes
2) The defendant's excuse is that he was confused whether national or local codes applied
3) The judge says this excuse might be acceptable if the defendant was charged with noncompliance of local codes
4) But since the defendant is charged with noncompliance of national codes, the judge finds the excuse unacceptable
The judge is essentially saying that ignorance or confusion between two different sets of codes (national vs local) is not an acceptable excuse for noncompliance with one of those codes.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) is not supported by the passage. The judge doesn't say anything about overlap between local and national codes.

3. The statement that participating in athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination is mentioned at the beginning, before the teacher's main argument. 
4. This statement is not the focus of the teacher's argument, nor is the teacher trying to refute it or provide more evidence for it. The teacher is not citing it as an objection to their position either.
5. Rather, the teacher is mentioning this potential benefit of athletic programs as an insufficient reason on its own to keep funding them.

2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take ""love"" in this context to be referring to feelings.

4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is too broad. The argument is specifically about feelings of love, not all feelings.
B) This fits as an unstated premise, but it's not quite right. The argument is more about how promises should be interpreted, not what promises should be made.
C) This could work as an assumption, but it's not necessary for the conclusion. Even if there are no other legitimate meanings of love, the conclusion could still follow.
D) This looks promising. If we assume that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense, then it would follow that love in wedding vows should not be interpreted as referring to uncontrollable feelings.

","Thought process:
The key to answering this question is finding the choice that best explains why smokers of low-nicotine and high-nicotine cigarettes end up with the same blood nicotine levels.
(A) suggests blood has a maximum nicotine absorption per day. But this doesn't explain equal levels between low and high nicotine cigarette smokers.
(B) states that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more per day than smokers of high-nicotine ones. This would help equalize the daily nicotine intake between the groups, explaining the study results. 
(C) and (D) discuss nicotine and tar absorption/levels but don't address differences between low and high nicotine groups.
(E) is about nicotine levels after stopping smoking, which is not relevant.
Therefore, (B) is the best answer. If low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, it would tend to equalize the total daily nicotine intake between low and high nicotine cigarette smokers. This directly helps explain why the two groups were found to have similar blood nicotine levels.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original argument has the following structure:
1) If X (the party's economic theories were sound) and Y (the party succeeded in implementing its program) were true, then Z (inflation would have lessened considerably) would have occurred. 
2) But Z did not occur (inflation actually increased).
3) Therefore, X was false (the party's economic theories were far off the mark).
The flaw is that the argument ignores the possibility that Y did not occur (the party failed to implement its program), which could also explain why Z did not happen.
Now let's examine each answer choice:
A) If X (people invaded) or Y (dramatic climate change), then Z (changes in architecture). Z did not occur, therefore X and Y did not occur. This has a similar structure and flaw as the original.
B) If X (opposition party wins and keeps promise), then Y (workers will strike). Y will not occur, therefore X will not occur. This is different - it reasons from Y not occurring to conclude X won't occur.
C) If X (company sold subsidiaries) and Y (used cash to buy patent), then Z (stock price doubles). Z did not occur, therefore X did not occur. This has the same structure and flaw.
D) If X (rebels won) and Y (rebel leaders freed), then Z (residents show support). Z occurred, therefore X occurred. This reasons from Z occurring to X occurring, which is different.
E) If X (new equipment worth investment), then Y (forecast accuracy rises) and Z (ratings rise). Z did not occur, therefore X is false. This has the same structure and flaw as the original.
Based on this analysis, choices A, C and E have the most similar flawed reasoning to the original argument. But the question asks for just one answer.

  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument's main points are:
1) Tears contain hormones produced during emotional stress
2) Crying removes these hormones from the body
3) Therefore, crying must reduce emotional stress
The argument assumes that because tears contain stress hormones (correlation/co-occurrence), the act of crying and removing those hormones causes a reduction in stress (causation).
However, this is a flawed assumption. Just because the hormones are present in tears when someone is stressed, it doesn't necessarily mean that removing those hormones via crying is what reduces the stress. 
The argument confuses a condition that correlates with stress (the presence of certain hormones in tears) with a condition that would be sufficient in itself to reduce stress (the removal of those hormones through crying).
But there could be other reasons why crying tends to reduce stress (e.g. the emotional release, comfort from others, etc.) unrelated to the hormonal content of the tears themselves. The argument overlooks these possibilities.
Therefore, the reasoning is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it ""confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon"".

  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The museum only displays 20th century works, either on loan from private collectors or from the museum's permanent collection.
2. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store. 
3. The museum store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.
4. Nighthawks is a 20th century work, since the museum only displays 20th century works. But we don't know if it's on loan to the museum or not displayed.
5. Choice A is incorrect, since the store sells prints of some works like Nighthawks that are not necessarily on loan or in the permanent collection.
6. Choice B looks correct - the store only sells prints of 20th century works, whether from the permanent collection, on loan, or neither (like Nighthawks).
7. Choice C is incorrect, as there may be works on loan that don't have prints in the store.
8. We can't conclude D is true, as we don't know if Nighthawks is on loan.

  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute over 30 minutes because they can't afford housing within a 30 minute commute of the new location.
2. For this to be a meaningful change, it must be assuming that the current situation is different - i.e. that currently most employees do NOT have a 30+ minute commute. 
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This goes too far. We don't know if ALL employees currently have <30 min commutes, just that most do.
B) The chairperson's reasons for the move are not discussed and not necessary for the argument.
C) Employee sentiment about the move is not mentioned and not relevant.
D) This matches the assumption we identified in step 2 as being required for the argument to make sense.
E) While a big pay raise could theoretically offset the housing cost issue, no information about compensation is given, so this is not a required assumption.
Therefore, the argument requires assuming choice D - that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.

  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the original exchange are:
1) Patricia claims there was little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas.
2) Tamara objects, saying many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to warn of ninjas.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to explain why the squeaky floors don't necessarily mean there was a lot of ninja activity or that people feared ninjas.
Looking at the choices:
A) Poor people also having squeaky floors is irrelevant to the main point.
B) Ninjas being able to walk silently on squeaky floors directly counters Tamara's objection. If true, it would mean the floors were ineffective at detecting ninjas.
C) The wealthy being a small portion of the population is somewhat relevant. It suggests squeaky floors were uncommon overall. However, it doesn't fully address the fear of ninjas.
D) Ninjas being mythologized later is not directly relevant to the Tokugawa period itself.
E) The prevalence of ninjas at other times doesn't impact the Tokugawa period.
Considering the self-reflection keywords, I had previously focused too much on population size. The strongest counter is the one that most directly addresses Tamara's point about using squeaky floors to detect ninjas.
Therefore, B is the best answer. If ninjas could silently cross squeaky floors, it would render that defense useless, supporting Patricia's claim that fear of ninjas was not widespread.

  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person. This suggests that a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not others, depending on which proteins that cat produces and which proteins a particular person is allergic to.
2. The passage also says there is no such thing as a cat that can't provoke allergic reactions at all, since all cats shed skin and saliva. However, it notes that a specific cat often causes reactions in some, but not all, people with cat allergies.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A is not strongly supported, as the passage focuses on individual cats and people, not cat breeds.
B matches the information given - any one cat may cause reactions in some allergy sufferers but not others. 
C is possible but not directly stated or implied. The passage doesn't compare proteins between cats.
D is not mentioned; the passage doesn't discuss reaction intensity.
E contradicts the idea that a cat often affects some allergy sufferers but not others.

The original argument's flaw is assuming that because most A are B, and most B are C, then most A must be C. This is not necessarily true.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This has the same flaw - it assumes that because traffic increases lead to gas price increases, and gas price increases lead to consumer complaints, then traffic increases must lead to consumer complaints. This is the same flawed reasoning pattern.
B) This does not have the same flaw. It reasons that if most birds in the region are migratory, and most migratory birds leave by November, then few birds overall remain in winter. This is valid reasoning.
C) This also does not match the original flaw. It reasons that people who don't want to drive fast don't buy sports cars, so it's unsurprising most speeding tickets go to sports car drivers. No flawed assumption here.
D) This matches the original flaw. It assumes that because most nature photographers find portraits boring, and most portrait photographers like photographing dignitaries, then nature photographers must find photographing dignitaries boring. Same invalid reasoning pattern.
E) No flaw here. If most snow removal companies do lawn care in summer, and most summer lawn care companies hire extra summer workers, it logically follows that most snow removal companies hire extra workers in summer.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument makes two key claims:
1) Technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole. 
2) This is because those responsible for technological advances are almost always motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit, as evidenced by their focus on developing commercially viable technology.
The question is asking which of the answer choices represents the biggest weakness or vulnerability in this argument.
Considering each choice:
A) The premises are opinions/generalizations, but not impossible. Doesn't seem to be the main issue.
B) The argument does seem to assume that commercially viable technology can't also be beneficial to society. This is a significant assumption that the argument relies on without justification. Looks promising.
C) The argument is not really concerned with whether the pursuit of personal gain actually results in it. Not the main vulnerability.
D) This is very similar to B. The argument does assume that societal benefit is unlikely unless it is the explicit motivation. Another key assumption.
E) The argument is focused on practical outcomes and motivations, not theoretical shoulds/should nots. Not the central flaw.
Both B and D point out major assumptions the argument makes without support. But B seems to more directly capture the core reasoning flaw - the unwarranted assumption that commercial viability and societal benefit are mutually exclusive.
Therefore, B appears to be the best answer.
