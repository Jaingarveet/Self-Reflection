We know that the two chains of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases, and that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure.

Explanation: 
The passage describes how the Chukar Partridges angled their wings differently from birds in flight, aiming their flapping down and backward to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. This allowed them to climb steep ramps using a technique called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR). Therefore, the position of their flapping wings facilitated their traction on steep ramps.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. Dial observed that as the Chukars raced up steep ramps, they ""began to flap"" and ""aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force ... to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp"" (lines 49-53). Dial determined that the position of their flapping wings facilitated the baby Chukars' traction on the steep ramps.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the Chukars' speed, alternation of wing and foot movement, or continual hopping motions facilitated their traction on steep ramps.",B,B,1,1248,83,1331,

","Thought:
Tocqueville believes that the social changes will raise women and make her more and more equal to man, but he also believes that there are wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, and their faculties should have distinct employment. On the other hand, Mill believes that every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. Therefore, Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor, while Tocqueville believes that an individual's sex should be considered.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to.

","Thought:
The passage starts with the narrator's love of reading and how he learned to read and write before other children. It then shifts to the narrator's father's disapproval of books and his plan to send the narrator to work at the age of ten. The focus then shifts to the narrator's favorite place, the Sempere & Sons bookshop, and how he received the best gift he ever received from Sempere, an old volume of ""Great Expectations"" by Charles Dickens. The passage ends with the narrator's desire to learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles.
