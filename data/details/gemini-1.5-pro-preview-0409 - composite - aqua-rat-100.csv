","Thought:
I recall this question and my previous incorrect reasoning. I initially focused on maximizing single-letter codes, which led to a suboptimal solution. 
The key is to efficiently use both single and double-letter codes. 
With 4 letters, we can create 4 single-letter codes and 6 double-letter codes (combinations of 4 items taken 2 at a time), which is enough for 10 types of books.
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",B,D,0,435,103,538,

The previous attempt likely made an error in assuming equal work hours or miscalculating the individual contributions. The key is to determine the relative work rates and use them to distribute the total work done. 
Action: Answer(""[REDACTED]"") 
","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

","Thought:
I recall this question and my previous error. The key was recognizing the relationship between the angle of elevation and the distance to the tower's base, forming a right triangle. 
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

The number of cubes with 3 faces painted (corner cubes) is 8.
Therefore, the number of cubes with at least one face painted is 27 + 54 + 36 + 8 = 125.

The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is (118/3) / (182/3) = 59/91.
Action: Answer(""D"") 
","The ratio of zinc and copper in mixture 1 is 6/9 and in mixture 2 is 7/11.
40 grams of mixture 1 contains 6*40/15=16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper
60 grams of mixture 2 contains 7*60/18=77/3 grams of zinc and 110/3 grams of copper
Thus, ratio =(16+77/3)/(24+110/3) =59/91

","Thought:
The trains have a frequency of 10 minutes each. 
This means a train arrives every 10 minutes on each line.
The harbor line starts 2 minutes after the main line, so there's a 2-minute window where only the main line train is available.
After that, both lines have trains running every 10 minutes, so the probability of catching either train is equal.
Therefore, the probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time window where only the main line is running (2 minutes) to the total time between trains on either line (10 minutes).
Action: Answer(""A"") 
","For each 10 min interval, if man comes in first 2 min, he'll catch the 1st train, if he comes in next 8 min, he'll catch the 2nd train.
Hence, for harbor line = (2/10) = 0.2 and for main line 0.8.
