These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care.

","Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I chose option A, thinking that bicarbonate buffers are ideal because their pKa is equal to the pH of blood. However, I realized that the correct answer is option C, which states that bicarbonate buffers are ideal because they are a combination of a weak acid (carbonic acid) and its conjugate weak base (bicarbonate ion). This means that they can effectively buffer both acidic and basic substances in the blood. Additionally, bicarbonate is present in high concentrations in the blood, which makes it an effective buffer. Option B is incorrect because high concentration alone does not make a buffer ideal. Option D is also incorrect because ease of measurement is not a factor in determining the effectiveness of a buffer. 
Action: Answer(""C"")","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U. Satyanarayan 4th)Advantages of bicarbonate buffer system* It is present in very high concentration than other buffer system (26 to 28 millimole per littre )* Produces H2CO3 which is weak acid and volatile and CO2 is exhaled out* Hence it is a very good physiological buffer and acts as a front line defense.Disadvantages - As a chemical buffer, it is rather weak, pKa is further away from the physiological pH",C,B,0,363,157,520,

","Self-reflection:
I misidentified the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst as infection. However, after reviewing the topic, I realized that the major complication is actually fistula formation. A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can form between the cyst and the stomach, leading to leakage of pancreatic enzymes into the stomach and subsequent inflammation. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Fistula.

I previously answered this question incorrectly. I chose option A: Suxamethonium as the shortest acting skeletal muscle relaxant.

Based on this, the correct answer to the question ""Agoraphobia is?"" is B: Fear of crowds.","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fear of crowded Agoraphobia* This is an example of irrational fear of situations. It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice.* It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from familiar setting of home and patient believes that he cannot escape from these places, to a safer place (usually home). This fear results in avoidance of these places which include public places, stores, crowd, travelling alone in bus, train or plane, Theaters, Tunnels, Bridge, standing in line small enclosed rooms or lifts.* The patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be perceived to be difficult if he suddenly develops embarrassing or incapaciating symptoms.
