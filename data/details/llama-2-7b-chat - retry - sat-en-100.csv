Context: \section{Passage 1}
Question: Which choice identifies a central tension between the two passages?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the central tension between the two passages is the disagreement between Douglas and Lincoln on the issue of slavery. Douglas argues that the Constitution allows for the expansion of slavery, while Lincoln disagrees and believes that it is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. This central tension is evident in the language used by both speakers, with Douglas emphasizing the importance of states' rights and Lincoln highlighting the moral and ethical implications of slavery.

Answer: C) Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is retry because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is retry because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is retry because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",,C,0,1398,183,1581,

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

The passage suggests that the authors of Passage 1 believe that women's roles in society, including running a household and raising children, yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men. The authors argue that women's exclusion from political rights and functions is a political phenomenon that cannot be explained on abstract principles, and that women's delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and duties of motherhood set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties. They also argue that women's education and situation are such that they are not prepared to become the companions of men in the pursuit of knowledge and virtue.

The passage does not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for men as well as for women, or that these activities entail very few difficult or unpleasant tasks. Rather, the authors imply that women's roles are inherently different from and less valuable than men's, and that this is a natural and justifiable state of affairs.

Therefore, the best answer is (B) Yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 state that women should seek ""gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" so they can avoid performing difficult, or ""strenuous,"" and unpleasant, or ""onerous,"" tasks.Choices A, B, and D are retry because the authors of Passage 1 do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require professional or political skills.",B,C,0,1425,250,1675,

","  The central claim of the passage is:

C: The male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.

In the passage, the author argues that educated women have been excluded from positions of power and influence in English society, and that this exclusion has had significant consequences for both men and women. The author suggests that women have been marginalized and excluded from participating in the ""procession of the sons of educated men,"" and that this has led to a lack of diversity and perspective in positions of power. The author also notes that women have been expected to conform to traditional gender roles, such as being homemakers and caregivers, rather than pursuing careers in fields such as law, medicine, and politics. The passage concludes by emphasizing the importance of women's participation in these fields in order to challenge the male monopoly on power and to create a more equitable and just society.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

The passage describes how Ken Dial and his son Terry observed young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds running along behind their parents and jumping up like popcorn. Ken Dial designed an experiment to study how baby game birds learned to fly, focusing on the Chukar Partridge as a model species. However, during the experiment, Terry noticed that the baby Chukars were using their legs instead of flying up to their perches. This observation led Ken to realize that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, which opened up a world of possibilities for further study.

Therefore, the best answer is (C) An anomaly is observed and simulated experimentally; the results are compared with previous findings, and a novel hypothesis is proposed. The passage describes an unexpected finding (the birds using their legs instead of flying) that is observed and simulated experimentally, and the results are compared with previous findings (the birds' preference for elevated perches) to propose a new hypothesis (WAIR, or wing-assisted incline running).","Choice D is the best answer.

During Passage 1, Mr. Lincoln suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth. He argues that the Constitution, which joined free and slave states together, was contrary to the law of God and could not stand. This implies that the Constitution did not include any means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states, and that the provision for slavery was not anticipated to be limited to a specific geographical area.

Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then, in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being ""none of her business."" Only once had she put the doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her. She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on ""by another train."" Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks.""You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet,"" said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument.""Very well, if I must I must,"" said Lady Carlotta to herself with dangerous meekness.""I am Mrs. Quabarl,"" continued the lady; ""and where, pray, is your luggage?""""It's gone astray,"" said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctness. ""I've just telegraphed about it,"" she added, with a nearer approach to truth.""How provoking,"" said Mrs. Quabarl; ""these railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night,"" and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.""I wish them not only to be TAUGHT,"" said Mrs. Quabarl, ""but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.""""I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""""That will not embarrass me in the least,"" said Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Question: The passage most clearly implies that Lady Carlotta is

Answer: B: tactful.

Explanation: Throughout the passage, Lady Carlotta exhibits a tactful attitude towards various situations. She refuses to interfere on behalf of a distressed animal, despite the disapproval of her acquaintances, and instead chooses to proceed with her own activities. When confronted by Mrs. Quabarl, she is meek and submissive, and does not express any surprise or admiration at the large and expensive car. Instead, she alludes to the superior advantages of other makes, which further highlights her tactful nature.

The main purpose of the passage is to question the feasibility of an undertaking. The author is not emphasizing the value of a tradition (A), stressing the urgency of an issue (B), or highlighting the severity of social divisions (C). Instead, the passage is focused on the idea that the procession of educated men may not be leading to a desirable future and that it is important to think critically about where this procession is heading. The author raises questions about the purpose of education and the value of the professions that educated men enter, suggesting that there may be alternative paths to follow. The passage concludes by emphasizing the need for critical thinking and reflection in order to determine the feasibility of this undertaking.","Choice B is the best answer.

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy over slavery has historically been ""excited by the effort to spread [slavery] into new territory,"" as in the case of Missouri, Texas, and ""the territory acquired by the Mexican War.""

The narrator pays close attention to the actions and emotions of the people around her, including Old Widow Lau, Little Uncle, and Father. She notices their reactions and responses to the different situations they encounter in the ink shop, and she is empathetic towards their needs and feelings. For example, when Old Widow Lau refuses to sit down, the narrator understands her reluctance and tries to persuade her to do so. Similarly, when Father is busy with a customer, the narrator waits patiently and observes his interactions with the customer, showing her interest in their conversation. These instances demonstrate the narrator's sympathetic nature towards others.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat.""

I previously answered choice (A) The corrupting influence of a materialistic society as the best description of a major theme in the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is retry. The passage does not suggest that materialism is a major theme. Instead, it highlights the growth and development of Silas and Eppie's relationship, as well as Eppie's curiosity and exploration of the world around her. Therefore, the best description of a major theme in the passage is choice (C) The bittersweet brevity of childhood naiveté. Eppie's innocence and curiosity are contrasted with the complexity and nuance of Silas' thoughts and emotions, highlighting the fleeting nature of childhood and the inevitability of growth and change.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom."" But after adopting Eppie, Silas became more interested in life outside his job: ""Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life."" A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is retry because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is retry because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in a lower percentage of surface covered with weeds compared to the strip plowed at night. This is because the method of weed control proposed by Hartmann involves plowing at night, when the photon fluence rate is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second, which minimizes the germination of weed seeds. Therefore, the percentage of surface covered with weeds on the strips planted with wheat or corn would likely be lower than the percentage found by Hartmann.","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is retry. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is retry because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry.

Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals. She argues that rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, and that the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman. Grimké asserts that when human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. Therefore, her central claim is that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals, and that men and women have equal moral rights.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are retry because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66).

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A. Upon reflecting on my mistake, I realized that the passage does not suggest that brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Instead, it suggests that the emotional aspect of touch is conveyed through CT fibers, which are specifically activated in the insular cortex when a person experiences a pleasurable sensation. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D.","Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is retry because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",D,B,0,1576,102,1678,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (D) naive. Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories as being naive because he believes that the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. This is supported by the passage, which states that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans living in the United States and that the Republicans should expect the subject races to protest against such a policy. Bryan's criticism is based on the assumption that the islanders would not want to be governed by Americans, which is a naive view.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

","  Topic: English

Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.

No reflection information provided.

Answer: (After reflection)
The correct answer is (C) The narrator hints at Silas's former antisocial attitude by contrasting his present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them.

Explanation:
Before adopting Eppie, the narrator represents Silas as being antisocial and isolated. The gold is described as requiring nothing and being deaf to the song of birds, indicating that Silas is not interested in the world around him. The narrator also contrasts Silas's behavior toward his neighbors before and after adopting Eppie, suggesting that he was not very social before he met Eppie. This contrast implies that Silas was not very social or outgoing before he adopted Eppie, which is a technique the narrator uses to represent Silas's character before he adopted Eppie.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator describes Silas as having been so obsessed as to have felt required to worship the gold ""in close-locked solitude,"" with ""his thoughts in an ever-repeated circle"" centered on his hoard. Moreover, this obsession compelled him to ""sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.” These lines convey the extent to which Silas's behaviors were determined by his obsession.Choice B is retry because the narrator does not make it seem as if Silas's gold could reproduce on its own, with the first paragraph suggesting that his hoard was a consequence of hard work, his being ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web."" Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because even if the first paragraph mentions that, after Eppie's arrival, Silas thinks about ""the ties and charities that bound together the families of his neighbors,"" the passage never addresses how Silas interacted with those neighbors previously. Choice D is retry because the third paragraph makes clear that Silas is not only able to recall life before Eppie, but that with her in his life, ""his mind was growing into memory.""",,A,0,1378,672,2050,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
Then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

To answer this question correctly, I will use the information provided in the passage. According to the narrator, one consequence of Silas adopting Eppie is that he ""began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit."" This suggests that Silas' adoption of Eppie has led him to rediscover his interest in nature and his connection to the natural world. Therefore, the best answer is (B) better understands his place in nature.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator indicates that with the arrival of Eppie, Silas's thoughts turn from his work and his gold toward Eppie's future and his life with her: ""Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit - carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years."" By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is retry because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1. In Passage 1, the author argues that women should have the same rights as men because they are moral beings with the same inherent dignity and worth. However, in Passage 2, the author argues that the rights of the slave are not based on their sex, but rather on their moral nature as human beings. The author contends that the idea that men have higher rights and responsibilities than women is based on a flawed understanding of the relationship between sex and morality. Therefore, the best choice to summarize the relationship between the two passages is option B: Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not ""exert coercive influences"" that would put her ""out of her appropriate sphere"" (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is retry because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 .

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, as I selected option A, ""Women have moral duties and responsibilities."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage suggests that women's ethical obligations are often undervalued. The author argues that women have the same moral nature as men and are entitled to the same rights, despite societal expectations that they should prioritize domestic duties over political activism. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, ""The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.""","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is retry because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

","  Topic: English

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation: The passage states that the narrator was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment, and that Sempere held him in high regard. This suggests that Sempere's gift of Great Expectations was not just a random act of kindness, but rather a deliberate choice made out of appreciation for the narrator's love of reading and his potential as a reader. Therefore, the best reason for the narrator to consider Great Expectations as the best gift he ever received is because it was given to him by a friend who held him in high regard, and not just because it was a valuable book.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. The last paragraph makes clear the narrator's enthusiasm for Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, and it can be inferred from the last sentence of this paragraph that this enthusiasm motivated the narrator to aspire to a career as a writer: ""Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Choice B is retry because the passage doesn't discuss gifts the narrator has received in the past; although the father sometimes gave the narrator money to buy sweets and snacks, these weren't gifts since the narrator made the purchases himself. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because although it is clear from the passage that Sempere was kind and even indulgent to the narrator, there is no suggestion that this treatment was inspired by respect for the narrator.

  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The passage suggests that Tocqueville and Mill have different views on the proper position of individuals in society. Tocqueville believes that an individual's sex should play a significant role in determining their position, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor. Tocqueville argues that women and men have different natural roles in society, and that men and women should be separated in terms of their occupations and duties. Mill, on the other hand, argues that each individual should have the liberty to choose their occupation without any favor or discouragement based on their sex.

Therefore, choice ""C"" best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society. Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by their sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is retry because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is that the second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open. According to the passage, the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close. This is because the second trigger hair helps to increase the concentration of calcium ions in the trap, which is necessary for the trap to close. The passage states that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the required level of calcium concentration, and therefore a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. This is supported by subsequent research that demonstrates that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, and that the amount of electrical current needed to close the trap is directly related to the amount of calcium ions present in the trap. Therefore, the correct answer is that the second trigger hair prompts the calcium channels to open, allowing for the increase in calcium concentration necessary for the trap to close.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant.

Upon re-reading the passage, I realized that Woolf chooses the setting of the bridge because it is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men. The bridge serves as a vantage point from which to observe the procession of educated men, and it also represents the connection between the past and the present. The passage mentions the river flowing beneath the bridge, which symbolizes the passage of time and the continuity of the procession.

Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four down the middle. The decoration was art moderne, except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears. While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France. A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie. The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, ""I didn't think you were coming."" Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button. Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Question: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation: The main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident. The narrator's encounter with Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a pivotal moment in the passage, as it marks the beginning of the narrator's obsession with reading and his desire to become a writer. The passage highlights the impact that this book had on the narrator's life, as he read it repeatedly and became convinced that he wanted to do the same thing as Mr. Dickens. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) depiction of the narrator's father.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is retry because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is retry because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",B,A,0,1319,988,2307,

","  Action: Answer(""D"")

The correct answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.

In Passage 1, the author mentions that the first space miners may enrich themselves by meeting earthly demands for precious metals and rare earth elements, such as platinum, gold, and yttrium. This implies that these resources will be valuable on Earth and may increase in value as they become scarce.

In Passage 2, the author discusses the potential for water ice from the moon's poles to be used as a radiation shield or for drinking on the International Space Station. This highlights the importance of water in space travel and suggests that it may become a highly valued resource in the future.

Therefore, the answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet. Passage 2 says this explicitly in lines 74-76: ""The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth."" Meanwhile Passage 1 suggests that water mined from space may be more valuable than metals or other earth elements when creating an ""off-plant economy"" lines 25-30).Choice B is retry because neither passage discusses, either implicitly or explicitly, the need for space mining to be inexpensive.

This is evident in the passage when it states, ""In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm.""

During my initial response, I incorrectly selected answer choice (A) as the main purpose of including the information about X-ray evidence and density.

B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

According to the passage, Volkov's experiment showed that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, but he did not measure calcium levels, which is a key component of Hodick and Sievers's model. The passage states that the model proposes that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level, therefore a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold. If Volkov did not measure calcium levels, it is possible that his experiment did not corroborate this central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is retry because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that Lincoln would agree with claim (A) that it can be ended only if Northern states act unilaterally to abolish slavery throughout the United States. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Lincoln's speech suggests that he would actually agree with claim (B) that it would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned. Lincoln argues that the controversy over slavery has been exacerbated by efforts to spread it over more territory, and that peace has been maintained when it has been limited to its current bounds. Therefore, he would likely agree that the controversy could be alleviated if there were no further attempts to introduce slavery to new regions.","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is retry because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery.

The passage explains that the plant needs to maintain a high concentration of calcium ions in order to close, and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold. If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is retry because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is retry because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is retry because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",,C,0,1384,175,1559,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""describe a culture."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as indicated in option C. The speaker is expressing surprise and amusement at the young man's bold proposal and is curious about the feasibility of his plan. The paragraph does not criticize or describe a culture, but rather reacts to the unexpected situation.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is retry because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is retry because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is retry because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1562,107,1669,
