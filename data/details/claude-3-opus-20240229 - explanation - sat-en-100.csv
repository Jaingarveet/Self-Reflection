","Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question asks about the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
2. Looking at the ""Colonies without colony collapse disorder"" column in the table:
   - IAPV infected 5% of colonies without CCD
   - KBV infected 48% of colonies without CCD  
   - Nosema apis infected 81% of colonies without CCD
   - Nosema ceranae infected 0% of colonies without CCD
3. Of those percentages, 81% for Nosema apis is the highest.
Therefore, the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder is Nosema apis.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",C,D,0,1473,177,1650,

  A: 0 percent

","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","You're right, I made a mistake before by assuming there wasn't enough information. Let's look at this step-by-step:
1. The question asks what percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder had bees infected by all four pathogens.
2. Looking at the table, there is no explicit value given for the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that had all four pathogens. 
3. However, we can infer this value by looking at the percentages for each individual pathogen in the colonies with colony collapse disorder:
   Viruses: 83%
   IAPV: 100% 
   KBV: 90%
   Fungi: 100%
4. For all four pathogens to be present, the percentage needs to be as high as the lowest individual pathogen percentage. 
5. The lowest percentage among the four pathogens is 83% for viruses.
Therefore, in at least 83% of the colonies with colony collapse disorder, the bees were infected by all four pathogens. The correct answer is C.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",C,B,0,1433,246,1679,

  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","You're right, I misinterpreted the main point of Passage 1 in my previous attempt. Let me take another look at it with your feedback in mind:
The key points in Passage 1 are:
- It pushes back on Lincoln's claim that a nation divided into free and slave states ""cannot stand"" and is ""contrary to the law of God."" 
- It argues that the current system, with the Constitution allowing both free and slave states, has enabled the nation to grow tremendously in population, territory, wealth and power.
- It suggests the current Constitutional structure is sound and just needs each state to respect the rights of other states and ""mind its own business"" in order to continue working.
- Territorial expansion is mentioned, but more to emphasize how well the current system has worked rather than being the main point.
So in summary, the main argument of Passage 1 is that the Constitution's allowances for slavery do not need to be changed, as the current structure has worked very well. It provides a good basic framework as long as states' rights are respected.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1389,252,1641,

","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","You're right, upon re-reading the passage and considering your explanation, I see that Akira's greatest fear is that Chie will consider his untraditional, direct proposal to be inappropriate. A few key details support this:
1. Akira says ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal."" This directly acknowledges he is aware his approach breaks social norms and may be seen as improper.
2. He explains he is asking directly because going through a go-between ""takes much time"", suggesting he knows the proper protocol but is choosing to circumvent it out of urgency, even though it risks appearing unseemly. 
3. The passage notes Akira ""came directly, breaking all tradition"" and ponders if Chie would have been more receptive if he had ""followed form"" by using a go-between. This further emphasizes how his direct approach is untraditional and risks being poorly received.
4. His apology for startling her and the abruptness of his exit also hint at his worry that he has overstepped bounds of propriety.
So in summary, while Chie does view him as childlike, the passage suggests Akira's greatest concern is appearing inappropriate by breaking social norms with his direct, urgent proposal. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal.

  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.

  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","You're right, I see now that the passage portrays the narrator as reserved and shy, especially around unfamiliar people like Big Uncle who doesn't recognize her at first. She speaks in a ""shy voice"" and seems to hang back, letting Old Widow Lau do the talking. While she is observant of her surroundings, the passage emphasizes her reserved nature more than her attentiveness.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",A,A,1,1366,96,1462,

","You're right, upon further reflection the first paragraph is primarily analyzing Chie's reaction to Akira's untraditional approach. The questions posed like ""Was that it?"" and ""would Chie have been more receptive?"" show the paragraph is examining her response and whether it would have differed if he followed tradition. The paragraph is not mainly describing the culture, criticizing the tradition itself, or questioning Akira's suggestion. Rather, it's analyzing Chie's reaction to his break from tradition.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1616,118,1734,
