Passage 1: Lincoln argues that the Constitution is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand.
Passage 2: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is retry because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is retry because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

**Correct answer:** A: Passage 2 strongly challenges the point of view in Passage 1.
**Reasoning for correct answer:** Passage 1 argues that women should not have political rights because their nature makes them unsuitable for such roles. Passage 2, however, strongly challenges this view by arguing that women are capable of reason and understanding their duties, and that excluding them from political participation hinders the progress of knowledge and virtue.

The passage does not mention the effect of planting wheat or corn on the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is retry. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is retry because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",C,A,0,1409,36,1445,

These lines signal the narrator's awareness that he was paying less for the books than they were worth.Choice A is retry because the passage states that Sempere didn't expect or want the narrator to pay: ""He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books."" Choice B is retry because the fourth paragraph makes clear that even if Sempere didn't want the narrator's money, the narrator would still ""leave the coins I'd managed to collect.""

Choices:
  A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.

  B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  C: No, because the data do not provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder.
  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
","## Analyzing the Data
The table shows the percentage of colonies affected by each pathogen, both for colonies with colony collapse disorder (CCD) and for colonies without CCD. 
## Comparing Percentages
For each pathogen listed (IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae), the percentage of colonies affected is **higher** for colonies with CCD than for colonies without CCD. This suggests that infection with these pathogens is **more common** in colonies experiencing CCD.
## Conclusion
Based on the data, there is support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections. This is because the presence of varroa mites weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to other pathogens.
## Action: Answer(""B"") 
","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The table discusses pathogen occurrence in honeybee colonies, but it includes no information as to whether these honeybees were infected with mites. Because the table does not suggest mites infested the honeybee colonies, no conclusions can be made as to whether mites increased the honeybees' ""susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria or viruses"" (lines 4-5).Choices A, B, and C are retry because the table provides no information about whether these honeybees were infected with mites.",B,D,0,1262,162,1424,
