The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, but for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.

Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, despite the lack of uniform, objective standards. The court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" There is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. Both passages seem to be concerned with the reliability of fingerprint evidence and the need for objective standards to evaluate it.

The passage discusses the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style. The narrator of Jazz is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. The central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak. The narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.

The concept of increasing returns to scale is described as the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.

The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects, specifically how insects have influenced the development of secondary substances in plants.
