","Reflection:

In the original argument, the radio producer presents a dilemma between sticking with classical music that appeals to a small but loyal audience or devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music to attract new listeners and generate more advertising revenue. The producer argues that they should not take the risk of sticking with classical music alone, as it may result in the station going out of business, and therefore, they should devote some airtime to other genres.

In answer choice B, the pattern of reasoning is similar to the original argument. The speaker presents a dilemma between making curtains or buying blinds for the windows. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if they buy blinds, they will have to special order them, and since they do not have time to wait for special orders, they should make the curtains.

In my previous answer, I incorrectly chose answer choice A, which presents a dilemma between buying blinds or making full-length curtains. However, the reasoning in this answer choice is based on cost, whereas the original argument is based on the risk of going out of business.

The argument assumes that if a stray cocker spaniel is found near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights because more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined.
To evaluate this assumption, it would be most useful to know whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners.

The strongest counter to Tamara's objection would be a statement that weakens the link between the squeaky floors and the fear of ninjas.
