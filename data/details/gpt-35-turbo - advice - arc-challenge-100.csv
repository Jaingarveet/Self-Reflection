A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?

  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. This suggests that the sheep with light wool have some advantage over the sheep with dark wool, which may help them survive and breed better. If a new sheep predator is introduced to the island, the sheep with light wool may have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool, as they may be better able to hide from the predator due to their lighter color. Therefore, an increase in the population of sheep with light wool is the most likely change to occur first.
