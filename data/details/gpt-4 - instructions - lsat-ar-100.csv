The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 6, because there is no higher number for the bay holding grain. The bay holding livestock also cannot be bay 1, because there is no lower number for the bay holding textiles. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 2, because that would mean the bay holding textiles would be bay 1, but the bay holding produce (which must be higher than the bay holding fuel) cannot be next to it. Therefore, the bay holding livestock can only be bay 3 or bay 5. However, if the bay holding livestock is bay 5, the bay holding grain would be bay 6, leaving no room for the bay holding produce to be higher than the bay holding fuel.

Given that Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and considering the conditions that Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Hong does not testify on Monday, and at least one witness testifies on Monday, we can deduce the following:
- Franco and Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
- Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday, leaving no room for Franco and Hong on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.

No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, which means Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo.

However, since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Lopez cannot be on the list with Kramer and O'Neill. Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, O'Neill, and potentially Megregian.

According to the conditions, the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We already have a botanist, a chemist, and two zoologists. 
The condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected is not violated because we have only one botanist and two zoologists. 
The condition that F and K cannot both be selected is not violated because K is not selected. 
The condition that K and M cannot both be selected is not violated because neither K nor M is selected. 
The condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected is not violated because M is not selected.

Given the conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. This means that each day must have a different kind of cookie being made.

Therefore, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (Choice A) cannot be false. 
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on one day. Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (Choice B) cannot be false.
The condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday does not specify the number of batches, so it could be one or more. Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (Choice C) could be false.

  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
","Thought: 
Given the conditions, Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 2. This is because if Parra was in Zone 2, then Tiao would have to be in both Zone 1 and Zone 2, which is not possible. Similarly, if Stuckey and Udall were in Zone 1, then Tiao would have to be in both zones as well, which is also not possible. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that Zone 1 has at least 3 representatives, Zone 2 has at least 2, and Zone 3 has at least 2. Since Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall, and Tiao's zones are already determined, the remaining representatives, Kim and Mahr, must be distributed in Zones 1 and 3. Therefore, the only possible answer is that Mahr works in Zone 2, which is not possible. So none of the options could be true.

The constraints are as follows:
1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
From these constraints, we can infer that:
- Textiles cannot be in bay 6 because there must be a bay with a higher number holding livestock.
- Livestock cannot be in bay 6 because there must be a bay with a higher number holding grain.
- Fuel cannot be in bay 1 because there must be a bay with a lower number holding produce.
- Produce cannot be in bay 1 because there must be a bay with a lower number holding textiles.
Given these inferences, the only type of cargo that cannot be in bay 4 is fuel because there must be at least three types of cargo (textiles, livestock, and grain) in bays with higher numbers.

4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- Day 1 cannot be Himalayan (condition 4) and Day 7 cannot be the same breed as Day 1 (condition 3), so Day 7 also cannot be Himalayan. 
- Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days (condition 4), the only possible days for Himalayans are Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days (condition 2), so the breeds on Day 3 and Day 5 must be different from Himalayan, and the breeds on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, and Day 7 must be different from each other.
Comparing these deductions with the options given, only option C fits all the conditions.

Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day and Friday is the only day with two sessions left, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Friday morning and afternoon sessions.

- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then:
- Julio cannot lead a session on Friday because his session must be earlier than Olivia's.
- Kevin cannot lead a session on Friday because he and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and there are only two sessions per day.
Given these constraints, let's evaluate the answer choices:
A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. This is possible.
B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. This is possible.
C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. This is possible because Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning. This is possible because Olivia cannot lead a session on the same day as Lan, who could lead a session on Wednesday.

Given that bay 4 is holding produce, and produce has a higher number than fuel, fuel must be in one of the bays numbered 1, 2, or 3. 
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. 
Since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, livestock cannot be in bay 3. Therefore, textiles must be in bay 5 and livestock must be in bay 6. 
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bay 6. But livestock is already in bay 6, so this is a contradiction.
