The lawyer states that accessing information in computer files without authorization is justified if the computer is typically used in the operation of a business and there are reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner.
A: Sunok had Rey's permission to use the store owners' computer, but there is no mention of the computer being used in the operation of a business or the existence of reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner. Therefore, this choice is not supported by the lawyer's principles.
B: The investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of the central computer owned by a consulting firm that was on trial for fraudulent business practices without seeking permission from the firm's owners. The computer was typically used in the operation of a business, and there were reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner. Although the files ultimately provided no evidence of wrongdoing, the investigators' action was still justified according to the lawyer's principles. Therefore, this choice is supported by the lawyer's principles.
C: The police officer accessed files on Natalie's computer without her permission. Although the computer was used exclusively in the operation of her small business, the police officer's search of the files on Natalie's computer produced no evidence usable in any legal proceeding against Natalie. Therefore, this choice is not supported by the lawyer's principles.
D: Customs officials examined all of the files stored on a laptop computer confiscated from an importer whom they suspected of smuggling. The computer was typically used in the operation of the importer's legitimate business, and there were reasonable grounds for believing that the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner. Therefore, this choice is supported by the lawyer's principles.
E: The police officer accessed some of the files on one of the company's computers against the company owner's wishes. Although the computer was typically used in the operation of the company's business, the particular files accessed by the police officer were personal letters written by one of the company's employees.

The defendant's excuse was that he was confused about which building codes applied to the area in which he was building.

","Self-reflection:
The argument is that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town, and the evidence is that local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year. To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that shows that the situation is not as bad as it seems. Option A is irrelevant because it talks about the overall crime rate, not just violent crime. Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about age, not the town's situation. Option C strengthens the argument because it shows that more people are reporting violent crimes. Option D is irrelevant because it talks about a community center, not the town's situation. Option E weakens the argument because it shows that a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

The conclusion drawn from the experiment is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. The evidence presented to support the conclusion is that most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, which is not directly related to the evidence presented in the argument. 
Action: Answer(""B"") 
Option B weakens the conclusion by presenting an alternative treatment that is believed to be more effective than magnets. This suggests that the reduction in pain reported by the patients in the first group may not be due to the magnets, but rather due to a placebo effect.

  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

1. The conclusion of the argument is that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
2. The premises of the argument are that most auto mechanics have extensive experience and that most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
3. The pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument is that it assumes that a majority of a group has a certain characteristic based on the fact that a majority of a subset of that group has that characteristic.
4. Answer choices A, C, D, and E do not present a similar pattern of flawed reasoning. Answer choice B presents a similar pattern of flawed reasoning in that it assumes that a majority of a group has a certain characteristic based on the fact that a majority of a subset of that group has that characteristic.

  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
","Thought:
The phenomenon described is that highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.
Answer choice C provides a direct explanation for this phenomenon by stating that most of the motorists on heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work. This means that the drivers on these highways are likely to be more experienced and familiar with the road, which could lead to fewer accidents.

","Self-reflection:
The main conclusion of the argument is that recent proposals to allow the use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. The premises that support this conclusion are that cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers, and that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. The statement in question is one of the premises that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do
","Thought:
The argument claims that technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole because those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit. This argument assumes that personal gain and societal benefit are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true. It also assumes that technological advances cannot be both commercially viable and beneficial to society as a whole, which is also not necessarily true.

  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
","Thought:
The argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate an identical penalty for both crimes. 
To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer choice that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Option A is too general and does not directly relate to the argument.
Option B is also too general and does not directly relate to the argument.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
Option D is the opposite of what we are looking for. It weakens the argument.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
