","Thought: We need to find an impression material that is elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.

Condensation silicone is elastic and sets by a chemical reaction, but it is typically catalyzed by tin or titanium.

Polyether is not elastic, but it sets by a chemical reaction and is usually catalyzed by amine or phosphorus.

Polysulfide is elastic and sets by an oxidation reaction; however, it is often catalyzed by lead or mercury.

Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) satisfies all the criteria: it is elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and can be catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.

The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

The vagus nerve is associated with swallowing and aspiration. However, it's important to consider its branches and specific functions. The spinal nerve (SLN), a branch of the vagus nerve, controls the constriction of the vocal cords during swallowing, preventing aspiration.

","Choices:
  A: Topical antibiotic
  B: Benzoyl peroxide
  C: Retinoids
  D: Estrogen
","Thought: 
Comedonal acne is a mild form of acne characterized by small, flesh-colored bumps called comedones, which are caused by clogged hair follicles and oil glands. The first-line treatment for comedonal acne typically includes topical retinoids, which are vitamin A derivatives that help unclog pores, normalize skin cell turnover, and reduce inflammation. While benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics can also be used in acne treatment, they are generally more effective for inflammatory types of acne lesions (like papules, pustules, or nodules) rather than comedonal acne. Estrogen can indeed improve acne in some cases, especially for those with hormonal imbalances, but it is not a first-line treatment and carries a different risk profile. Therefore, the best treatment option among these choices for comedonal acne is retinoids.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Retinoids are mainly comedolytic Acne Comedones are characteristic of: Acne vulgaris Comedones are: * Small cysts, * formed in hair follicles, * due to blockage of the follicular orifice * by the retention of sebum and keratinous material.
