  E: Most parts of the country are humid.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question states that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. 
2. We know that cacti are difficult to grow in humid climates, and orange trees are difficult to raise in cold climates.
3. Therefore, for it to be easy to grow cacti in most of the country, most of the country must not be humid. Similarly, for it to be easy to raise orange trees in most of the country, most of the country must not be cold.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) If half the country was both humid and cold, it would be difficult to grow either cacti or orange trees in that half. But we're told it's easy to grow one or the other in most of the country. So this statement could be false.
B) This doesn't contradict anything in the question. Most of the country could be hot and still have the conditions described.
C) This must be true. If most of the country is suitable for either cacti or orange trees, then some parts must be neither cold (ruling out orange trees) nor humid (ruling out cacti).
D) The question implies cacti can be grown in at least part of the country. So this statement must be false.
E) If most of the country was humid, it would be difficult to grow cacti in most of the country. But the question states cacti can be grown easily in most or all of the non-orange tree parts. So this statement must be false.
Therefore, the correct answer is C. It's the only one that must be true based on the information given.

A. We don't know if most Canadian films shown at international festivals won at Lac Nichoutec. The information only tells us about films that won at Lac Nichoutec, not all Canadian films at international festivals. 
B. We have no information about what proportion of Canadian films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
C. If most Lac Nichoutec winners also won at international festivals, then at least some prize winners at international festivals must have been Canadian. This logically follows from the given information.
D. The information allows for the possibility that some Lac Nichoutec winners did not win at international festivals. But it doesn't require this to be true.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The radio producer's argument has the following structure:
   - They have two options: devote some airtime to popular music genres, or stick only with classical music
   - Sticking only with classical music risks the station going out of business due to insufficient ad revenue
   - They conclude they should devote some airtime to popular music genres to avoid that risk
2. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This has a similar structure:
   - Two options are presented: buy blinds or make curtains 
   - One option (buying blinds) is noted to be very expensive
   - The conclusion is to choose the other option (make curtains) if cost is the main concern
   This matches the radio producer's reasoning of choosing one option over the other based on a key consideration (financial viability).
B) This is close but not quite the same structure. It presents two options and a reason to avoid one (special ordering blinds takes too long), but doesn't explicitly tie this to a core priority like A does with cost.
C) Not the same structure. Presents options but the reasoning is based on a desired feature (privacy) rather than avoiding a critical risk.
D) Somewhat similar in noting a limitation (little fabric) that influences the choice, but the reasoning chain is more complex and not as directly analogous.
E) Presents options and a reason to pair the choices (avoiding bare windows), rather than a reason to choose one over the other. Not the same structure.
Therefore, A is the closest match to the radio producer's argument structure.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The economics professor concludes that Checkers refused the coupons solely to hurt Marty's Pizza. 
2. The professor bases this on the fact that accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers.
3. So for the professor's conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to assume that if a company refuses to accept competitor coupons when doing so would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers, the only possible motive is to hurt the competitor.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This matches the assumption we identified in step 3. If we assume this, the professor's conclusion logically follows.
B) This is the reverse of what we need. It says if a company wants to hurt a competitor, it will refuse the coupons even if accepting costs nothing. But we need the reverse implication.
C) This just says at least one company has done this, not that it's the only possible motive. Doesn't enable the conclusion.
D) Not relevant, as the professor's conclusion is about Checkers' motive, not the effect on Marty's.
E) Also not relevant, as it's about the case where accepting coupons doesn't satisfy customers. 
Therefore, the correct answer is A. It provides the necessary assumption that refusing coupons that cost nothing to accept and satisfy customers can only be motivated by a desire to hurt the competitor.

2. However, the teacher then presents a counterargument - that competitive athletics can instill feelings of inferiority in children who are not already well-developed in these areas. 
3. Despite this counterargument, the teacher ultimately argues that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated. The reason given is that research shows adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those without such anxieties.
4. So the role of the initial assertion about increasing strength and coordination is that it's an insufficient reason on its own for maintaining funding for athletic programs. The teacher acknowledges this potential benefit but argues there are downsides too, before providing a different reason to support their position.

2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take ""love"" in this context to be referring to feelings. 
3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption. Let's look at each answer choice:
A) This is too broad. The argument doesn't require that none of our feelings are within our control, just that love (as a feeling) is not.
B) This is promising, as it directly supports the idea that one shouldn't promise what one can't control. But let's check the other options.
C) This could work as an assumption, but it's not necessary for the conclusion. Even if love can refer to something else, that doesn't mean it should in this context.
D) This looks correct. If we assume promises shouldn't be interpreted to make no sense, and interpreting ""love"" as a feeling makes the promise nonsensical, then we should not interpret ""love"" as a feeling in this promise.
E) This is similar to D, but a bit stronger. A promise could make sense even if it can't be kept (e.g., ""I promise to try my best"").

D: The tar level is not directly relevant to explaining blood nicotine level findings.
E: The decrease of blood nicotine after stopping smoking is not relevant to explaining equal nicotine levels in low vs high nicotine cigarette smokers.

E) This is very similar - if the new equipment was good, accuracy and ratings would rise. Ratings fell, so the equipment must be bad. But ratings could fall for other reasons even if the equipment is good.
Therefore, E most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the original argument.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument concludes that crying must reduce emotional stress because tears contain stress hormones, so shedding tears removes these hormones from the body.
A) This is a strong point. Even if crying removes stress hormones, the stress reduction could be due to something else about crying, not the removal of the hormones specifically. 
B) The argument does assume that the mere presence of stress hormones in tears is sufficient to conclude that shedding tears reduces stress. But it hasn't established that this is the only requirement, or a sufficient cause on its own.
C) The argument is not concerned with whether stress also causes crying. This is not the main flaw.
D) The argument does not mention any other factors working jointly with the stress hormones in tears. This is not the key issue.
E) This accurately captures the flaw. The argument jumps from the mere presence of stress hormones in tears to the conclusion that shedding tears must therefore reduce stress. But it hasn't ruled out that this is just a side effect, not the cause of stress reduction.
Therefore, E seems to be the best answer. The argument assumes that because stress hormones are present in tears, the shedding of tears must be what causes a reduction in stress. But it hasn't properly established this causal link.

  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The museum only displays 20th century works, either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
2. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store. 
3. The museum store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.
4. Since Nighthawks is used as an example of a work not in the permanent collection but available as a print, we can infer it is a 20th century work (to be consistent with the museum's focus).
Looking at the answer choices:
A is retry because Nighthawks is an example of a print sold that is not on loan or in the permanent collection.
B looks correct. The museum only focuses on 20th century works, and Nighthawks is cited as an example print available, implying it is a 20th century work even though not part of the museum's collection. 
C is retry because not all displayed works have prints available, only permanent collection works do.
D is retry because we can't conclude Nighthawks is on loan to the museum, only that a print is sold in the store.
E is likely true that Nighthawks is not displayed, but not a required inference from the information given.
Therefore, B is the best answer.

  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes. 
2. For this to be a meaningful statement, we must assume that the commute time will increase for most employees after the move.
3. The argument does not provide information about:
   - The chairperson's financial reasons for the move (B)
   - The employees' opinions about the move (C) 
   - Whether the move will be accompanied by a pay raise (E)
4. While (A) could be true, it is not a necessary assumption. Even if some employees currently cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown, the argument still holds.
5. The only necessary assumption is (D) - that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. Without this assumption, the statement about the commute time increasing to more than 30 minutes for most employees after the move would not be meaningful.
Therefore, the argument requires assuming (D).

  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Patricia's main point is that there was actually very little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period, so most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time.
2. Tamara objects by saying that many wealthy Japanese had their houses built with squeaky floors specifically to get warning if a ninja entered. This suggests there was significant fear of ninjas.
3. To counter Tamara's point, Patricia needs to provide a fact that undermines the idea that the squeaky floors indicate widespread fear of ninjas among the Japanese population.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This doesn't help Patricia's case, as it suggests even more people feared ninjas. 
B) This would strengthen Tamara's point by implying the squeaky floors were a necessary precaution against stealthy ninjas.
C) This looks promising. If the wealthy were only a small part of the population, their fear of ninjas wouldn't necessarily mean most Japanese feared ninjas, which is Patricia's key claim.
D) and E) These choices are irrelevant to the specific point about fear of ninjas during the Tokugawa period.
Therefore, C is the best counter-argument for Patricia. It suggests that even if the wealthy feared ninjas (as indicated by the squeaky floors), this small group's fear doesn't mean most Japanese shared that fear, since the wealthy were a minority.

  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person. This suggests that a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some cat allergy sufferers but not others, depending on which proteins that cat produces and which proteins a particular person is allergic to.
2. The passage also says there is no such thing as a cat that cannot provoke allergic reactions at all, since all cats shed skin and spread saliva. However, it notes that a given cat commonly causes reactions in some, but not all, people with cat allergies. 
3. This directly supports choice B - no single cat will cause allergic reactions in every person with a cat allergy, because different allergy sufferers react to different cat proteins.
4. Choice A is not strongly supported, as the passage focuses on individual cats, not cat breeds. Choices C and D are not directly addressed by the information given.
5. While choice E has some merit, the passage suggests that knowing which proteins a person reacts to and which proteins a cat produces would allow predicting if that cat will trigger that person's allergies. So choice E is not the most strongly supported.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The original argument has the following structure:
   - Most A have property B
   - Most things with property B also have property C
   - Therefore, most A have property C
2. This reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the majority of things with property B are also A, which is not necessarily true.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) Increased traffic leads to increased gas prices, which leads to more consumer complaints. This is a causal chain argument, not the same structure.
   B) Most common birds are migratory, and most migratory birds leave by November, so few birds remain in winter. This follows the same flawed structure.
   C) This does not follow the same structure. It's more of a causal explanation.
   D) Most nature photographers find portraits boring, and most portrait photographers enjoy photographing dignitaries, so nature photographers find photographing dignitaries boring. This follows the same flawed structure.
   E) Most snow-removal companies do lawn-care in summer, and most lawn-care companies hire more workers in summer, so most snow-removal companies hire more in summer. This also follows the same structure.
4. Answers B, D, and E all exhibit the same flawed reasoning pattern as the original argument.
5. To choose between them, I'll re-examine the original argument. It's about two properties that are common to a group, and incorrectly concludes that the intersection of those properties is also common to the group.
