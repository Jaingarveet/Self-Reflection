The correct answer is D: 2x - y = 7a, where a is an arbitrary constant that we can choose.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

Using the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, we can calculate the mass of the object on Earth:
$150 = m * 9.8$

Now, we can find the planet where this object would weigh approximately 170 newtons:
Venus: $W = 15.3 * 8.9 \approx 136.71$

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$.

Expanding the left-hand side gives: 
$abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.

Equating coefficients: 
$ab = 15 \implies ab = 15$
$7a + 2b = c \implies 7a + 2b = c$
$14 = 14$ (a true statement).

Substituting $a+b=8$ into the second equation gives:
$7a + 2(8-a) = c \implies 13a = c - 6$.

$a$ can be either $3$ or $5$ (factors of $15$).

If $a = 3$, then $c = 39$.
If $a = 5$, then $c = 65$.

So the two possible values for $c$ are $39$ and $65$.

This question previously tripped me up because I didn't consider that $a$ and $b$ could be negative, which they must be for one of the solutions.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

Thought: Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median at all, as it falls in the middle of the list of numbers.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

$$24x^2 + (25+8a)x + (3a - 47 + 53) = 0$$

For this equation to be true for all values of $x$ other than $x = \frac{2}{a}$, the coefficients of the $x^2$, $x^1$, and constant terms on the left-hand side must be equal to zero when $x = \frac{2}{a}$.

","Thought: 
First, I'll rewrite the system of equations:
$2x - 3y = -14 \iff 3y = 2x + 14 \iff y = \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{14}{3}$
$3x - 2y = -6$. Substituting the expression for y from the first equation:
$3x - 2 \left( \frac{2}{3}x + \frac{14}{3} \right) = -6$
$3x - \frac{4}{3}x - \frac{28}{3} = -6$
$\frac{3}{3}x - \frac{4}{3}x = -6 + \frac{28}{3}$
$\frac{-1}{3}x = \frac{-6 + 28}{3}$
$x = 3$
Now, I can find $y$ by plugging $x$ back into the first equation:
$y = \frac{2}{3}(3) + \frac{14}{3} = 2 + \frac{14}{3} = \frac{20}{3}$
So, $x - y = 3 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{9 - 20}{3} = -\frac{11}{3}$.

This is outside the options provided, so I'll need to perform one more step to match the answer format. All the options are divisible by 4, so I'll multiply $x - y$ by 4:
$4 \left( -\frac{11}{3} \right) = -\frac{44}{3} = -14 \frac{2}{3}$.

Since $-14 \frac{2}{3}$ is very close to -16, I can conclude that $-16$ is the value that $x - y$ needs to be multiplied by to match the provided answer format.

This is not one of the answer choices, so I will review my interpretation of the question and the given choices.

Alan wants to spend $5 less, so he wants to find out how many fewer miles he should drive to achieve that $5 saving. The equation should represent the relationship between the number of miles driven and the cost savings, not the number of gallons.

The ball was launched upward, so its height will decrease over time until it hits the ground again.

The equation represents a parabola that opens downward, indicating that the height will decrease, reach a maximum, and then decrease again to zero as the ball returns to the ground.

To find when the ball hits the ground, we need to find when its height, $h$, becomes zero. 

Setting $h = 0$, we have:
$$0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$$

This can be rewritten as:
$$4.9t^2 - 25t = 0$$

Factoring the equation gives:

Substituting 0 for $h$ in $h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$ gives $0=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$, which can be rewritten as $0=t(-4.9 t+25)$. Thus, the possible values of $t$ are $t=0$ and $t=\frac{25}{4.9} \approx 5.1$. The time $t=0$ seconds corresponds to the time the ball is launched from the ground, and the time $t \approx 5.1$ seconds corresponds to the time after launch that the ball hits the ground. Of the given choices, 5.0 seconds is closest to 5.1 seconds, so the ball returns to the ground approximately 5.0 seconds after it is launched.Choice A, B, and C are incorrect and could arise from conceptual or computation errors while solving $0=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$ for $t$.",D,D,1,386,269,655,

  A: $f(n)=n-3$
  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$
  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$
  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
","Thought: 
The function $f$ has the form $y=mx+c$, where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the y-intercept.
Looking at the table, when $n=1$, $f(n)=-2$. So, the point $(-2,1)$ lies on the line.
Using the point-gradient formula $\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}=m$, we can find the gradient:
\[m=\frac{-2-(-3)}{1-1}=\frac{1}{0} \, .\]
This is undefined, so we cannot find the gradient using this method.

However, we can see that the difference between the $y$-values is 3, and the difference between the $x$-values is 1.
This means the gradient is $\frac{3}{1}=3$.

Now we can use one of the points to find the y-intercept.
Using the formula $y=mx+c$, we get:
\[-2=3\times1+c \, .\]
Solving for $c$, we find the y-intercept is $c=-5$.

Therefore, the function is $f(n)=3n-5$.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line that passes through each of the points given in the table. From the table, one can see that an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$; for example, $f 2)-f(1)=1-(-2)=3$. Therefore, the graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line with slope 3. Only choice $\mathrm{C}$ is a line with slope 3. The $y$-intercept of the line is the value of $f(0)$. Since an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$, it follows that $f 1)-f(0)=3$. Since $f(1)=-2$, it follows that $f(0)=f(1)-3=-5$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the graph of $f(n)$ is -5 , and the equation in slope-intercept form that defined $f$ is $f(n)=3 n-5$.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each equation has the incorrect slope of the line (the $y$-intercept in each equation is also incorrect).",C,C,1,437,284,721,

","Thought: 
Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.
The area of a rectangle is given by $A = LW$.

First, we calculate the new length and width of the rectangle.
The length increases by 10%, so the new length is $1.1L$.
The width decreases by $p$%, so the new width is $(1 - \frac{p}{100})W$.

Next, we set up an equation to account for the 12% decrease in the area.
The area of the altered rectangle is given by $A' = (1.1L)\left[(1 - \frac{p}{100})W\right]$.

We know that $A' = 0.88A$, so we can set up the following equation:
\[
0.88LW = (1.1)(1 - p/100)LW
\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
0.88 = 1.1(1 - p/100)
\]

Multiplying both sides by 100 and then dividing by 1.1, we get:
\[
96.8 = 100 - p
\]

Therefore, $p = \boxed{22}$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is incorrect because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease.
