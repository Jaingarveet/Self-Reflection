Choices:

","Thought: 
The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If the line passes through the origin, then the y-intercept must be zero. This means that when x=0, y must also be 0. 
We can set up the equation of the line using the slope and one of the points, (2, k), and then set y=0 and solve for x:
0 = [(32-k)/(k-2)]*(0-2) + k
0 = -2*(32-k)/(k-2) + k
0 = -64 + 2k + k(k-2)
0 = k^2 - 2k - 64
Solving this quadratic equation for k, we find that k = 8 or k = -8. However, k cannot be -8 because it's not in the choices. Therefore, the only possible value for k is 8.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$. Therefore, of the given choices, only 8 could be the value of $k$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and may be the result of computational errors.",C,C,1,619,214,833,

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites. Adding the left- and right-hand sides of the equations $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ produces $7.2 x+0.0 y=-3.6$, which is equivalent to $7.2 x=-3.6$.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.
