Each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters. Therefore, to represent 10 different types of books, Amy will need 10 different letters. 
Action: Answer(""D"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",D,D,1,722,47,769,

The profit per bag is 25% of the cost price. If the selling price is $100, then the cost price is $100 / 1.25 = $80. So, the profit per bag is $100 - $80 = $20.
If the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $20 = 150 bags.
However, none of the options match this result. There might be a mistake in the question or in my calculations. Let's try to think about it differently.
If the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, then the cost price for him is 75% of the selling price. So, the cost price per bag is 75/100 * $100 = $75. The profit per bag is then $100 - $75 = $25.
If the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $25 = 120 bags. This result also doesn't match any of the options.
Let's try to think about it in yet another way. If the profit is 25% of the selling price, then the profit per bag is 25/100 * $100 = $25. If the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $25 = 120 bags. This result also doesn't match any of the options.

The problem states that the student found 7/18 of a number instead of 7/8. The difference between these two values is 770. We can set up the equation as follows: 7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770. To solve this equation, we need to find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. So, we rewrite the equation as: 63/72*x - 28/72*x = 770. Combining the fractions gives us 35/72*x = 770.

First, I need to calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9=15. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40=16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40=24 grams.
For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11=18. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60=23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60=36.67 grams.
Then, I add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.
Finally, I find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.
However, if I round the amounts to the nearest whole number, I get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.

The expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) simplifies to x = n + 4. 
So, if 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then 40 ≤ x ≤ 76. 
None of the given options A, B, C, or D fully cover this range. 
The closest option is D: 28 < x < 60, which partially covers the range of x.
Action: Answer(""D"")","36 ≤ n ≤ 72
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)
Put x = 36,
x = (362 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36+ 4√36+ 4)
i.e which is least value for n = 28.

B: 91/2 = 45.5, not a perfect square.
C: 41/2 = 20.5, not a perfect square.

","Thought: 
The problem states that Susan must be on the left of Tim. This leaves two possible arrangements: Susan, Tim, Zen and Susan, Zen, Tim. However, since the chairs are identical, these two arrangements are considered the same. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the children so that Susan is on the left of Tim.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Total ways in which 3 children can be arranged on 3 chairs = 3*2*1 = 6
But in half cases Susan will be left of Tim and in other half of cases Tim will be on left of Susan
i.e. Desired cases in which Susan is on the left of Tim = (1/2)*6 = 3

In the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 10 minutes.
In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 20 minutes.
Since the number of steps you walk changes but the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps does not, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:

  B: 30

","Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
","Thought: 
Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. 
The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We know that the cost for the Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x and the cost for the newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is 6x * $1 = $6x. 
So, we can set up the equation: $8x (for Sunday) + $6x (for Monday to Saturday) = $210. 
First, combine like terms: 8x + 6x = 14x.
Then, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x: 210 / 14 = 15.
So, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Number of paper bought on monday = x
# of paper bought on sunday = 2x
Total cost = 210 = 6*x(rest of the day cost)+8*x (sunday cost)
14x = 210

  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
","Thought: 
Let's denote the breadth as x. Then the length is 4x + 1.
The area of the rectangle is length * breadth = 150 sq m, so x * (4x + 1) = 150.
Solving this equation gives x = 5 and 4x + 1 = 21.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + breadth), so the perimeter is 2 * (21 + 5) = 52 m.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 m
