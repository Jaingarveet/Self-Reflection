  D: Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned. 40
","Thought: 
In the first passage, Douglas criticizes Lincoln for suggesting that the government, which is divided into Free and Slave States, is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. In the second passage, Lincoln clarifies his position, arguing that the division is not due to the variety of institutions in different states, but due to the element of slavery. He suggests that the quarrels and difficulties have always been over slavery, especially when there are efforts to spread it into new territory. 
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

This suggests that they made the most extensive use of information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The second sentence of the last paragraph says that the focus of Volkov's work was the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism. The paragraph goes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant and ""altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close."" It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple ""published theories"" or ""earlier models""; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model.",C,C,1,1175,84,1259,

","Thought: 
According to Hodick and Sievers's model, the Venus flytrap will not close if the second contact with a trigger hair happens after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.

It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",B,B,1,1204,101,1305,

Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect.

The text mentions that Sempere gave the narrator a book by Charles Dickens, referring to Dickens as a ""lifelong friend."" This suggests that Sempere has a deep admiration for Dickens's work. There is no mention of Sempere modeling his writing after Dickens, feeling a personal connection to Dickens's biography, or considering himself to be Dickens's most appreciative reader.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the ninth paragraph, Sempere describes the author Charles Dickens to the narrator: ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" As the reader can reasonably assume that Sempere doesn't actually know Dickens, this description can be read as signaling Sempere as an avid admirer of Dickens's work.Choice A is incorrect because the passage describes Sempere as a bookseller, not a writer. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because although the passage implies Sempere feels an emotional connection to Dickens, it doesn't suggest that this connection arises from any similarity between Sempere's life and that of Dickens.

","Thought: 
In Passage 1, Tocqueville discusses the roles of men and women in society, suggesting that their positions should be defined by their sex, as nature has appointed wide differences between them. In Passage 2, Mill argues for equality and liberty of choice, stating that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor for their position in society. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1296,80,1376,

  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
","Thought: 
The passage explains that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions. However, a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level required for the trap to close. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. This suggests that the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant.

The phrase ""make a survey"" means to carefully examine an event or activity. Woolf wants educated women to ""fix [their] eyes upon the procession - the procession of the sons of educated men"" (lines 9-11) walking to work.Choice $A$ is incorrect because while Woolf states the bridge ""is a place to stand on by the hour dreaming,"" she states that she is using the bridge ""to consider the facts"" (lines 6-9). Woolf is not using the bridge for fanciful reflection; she is analyzing ""the procession of the sons of educated men"" (lines 10-11).

The passage states, ""When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else."" This suggests that the people at the train station feel that Miss Spivey is downplaying their discomfort with the heat, which would lead to resentment.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. In the first paragraph, Miss Spivey remarks that the heat in Georgia is nothing compared to the heat she experienced in Timbuktu. Later in this paragraph the narrator states, ""I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else.""

The passage mentions that Volkov and his colleagues tested the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. However, they did not measure calcium levels, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. Therefore, a potential criticism could be that Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","Thought: 
The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers (touching of hairs) to close its trap. This mechanism ensures that the plant doesn't waste energy closing its trap for prey that is too small or not worth the energy expenditure. Therefore, this system safeguards the plant's energy supply.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1140,68,1208,
