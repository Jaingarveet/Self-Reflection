","Thought:
Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to external factors such as injury, infection, or toxins. It is characterized by the loss of cell membrane integrity, leading to the release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue.
The primary cause of necrosis is not calcium efflux, fat deposition, or water imbibition. Instead, it is due to enzymatic digestion of the cell by its own lysosomal enzymes or by external enzymes released from damaged cells.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Necrosis: Type of cell death associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents culminating in the dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The enzymes responsible for digestion of cells may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cell themselves and from lysosomes of leucocytes recruited as pa of inflammation. The leaked cellular contents often elicit an inflammatory response. Leakage of intracellular proteins through the damaged cell membrane and ultimately into circulation provides a means of detecting tissue-specific necrosis by blood/serum samples. {Reference: Robbins basic pathology9E, pg no.9}",D,D,1,313,126,439,

The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

ESR stands for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is a test that measures how quickly red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube. An increased ESR is a non-specific indicator of inflammation or tissue damage.

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down, leading to anemia and other complications. It can cause an increased ESR due to chronic inflammation.

Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell. It can cause an increased ESR due to the production of abnormal proteins that interfere with normal blood cell function.

Polycythemia is a condition in which there is an overproduction of red blood cells. It can cause a decreased ESR due to the increased viscosity of the blood.

Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently. It can cause an increased ESR due to inflammation and tissue damage, but it is not a common cause of an elevated ESR.

Action: Answer(""A"") or Answer(""B"")

Explanation: Both sickle cell anemia and multiple myeloma can cause an increased ESR.

The symptoms described in the question, including delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting, are consistent with a bowel obstruction in a neonate.
Barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings are provided, which are important for the diagnosis.
A barium enema would show a narrowed segment of the colon with a transition zone in congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease), while an intestinal biopsy would show the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents with non-bilious, projectile vomiting, and a palpable ""olive-like"" mass in the epigastric region.
Cystic fibrosis can present with meconium ileus, but this is usually diagnosed prenatally or at birth, and the symptoms described are not typical.
Intestinal malrotation can present with bilious vomiting, but this is usually associated with midgut volvulus, which is a surgical emergency, and the barium enema findings would be different.

The most common type of malignancy of the stomach is adenocarcinoma, accounting for approximately 90-95% of all stomach cancers.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Ans. A: Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A,A,1,317,45,362,

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country.2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role.3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat. Appointment of medical officers at state headquarters in order to make their monitoring role more effective;5.

","Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration

","Thought:
The ideal buffer system should have a pKa value close to the pH of the solution it is buffering. In the case of blood, the pH is around 7.4, and the pKa of the bicarbonate buffer system is 6.1. However, the bicarbonate buffer system is effective in blood because of the presence of carbonic anhydrase enzyme in red blood cells, which rapidly converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, maintaining the pH balance. Additionally, the bicarbonate buffer system is an open system, meaning that the concentration of carbon dioxide can be adjusted through respiration, making it an effective buffer in the body.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Neonatal seizures: Usual onset at 12-48 hours. Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
","Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
","Thought:
Recurrent aspirations can be caused by dysphagia, which is a difficulty in swallowing. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for the motor function of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, and it also provides sensory information from these areas. Injury to the vagus nerve can cause dysphagia and aspiration.

The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for the sensation of the posterior third of the tongue, the pharynx, and the middle ear, and it also controls the stylopharyngeus muscle, which helps elevate the larynx during swallowing. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can cause dysphagia, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

The SLN nerve (superior laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides sensory information from the larynx and motor function to the cricothyroid muscle, which helps control the pitch of the voice. Injury to the SLN nerve can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

The RLN nerve (recurrent laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides motor function to all the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle. Injury to the RLN nerve can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.

Since the patient has no change in voice, it is unlikely that the SLN or RLN nerve is injured. Therefore, the most likely nerve to be injured during surgery is the vagus nerve.

","Thought:
The symptoms described in the question are consistent with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. The basic abnormality in cystic fibrosis involves a defective gene that regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This leads to thick, sticky mucus in various organs, including the pancreas.

The correct answer is ""C: Decreased glycosylated chloride channel"" because the defective gene in cystic fibrosis encodes for a protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which functions as a chloride channel. The mutation in the CFTR gene results in decreased activity of this channel, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases that affects white populations (1/2000). The primary abnormality in patients with cystic fibrosis involves the epithelial transpo of chloride. Normally, binding of a ligand to a membrane surface receptor activates adenyl cyclase, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP. This in turn activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), causing it to open and release chloride ions. Sodium ions and water then follow the chloride ions to maintain the normal viscosity of mucus. The most common abnormality in patients with CF involves decreased glycosylation of the CFTR, which then does not become incorporated into the cell membrane. A lack of chloride channels then causes decreased chloride, sodium, and water secretion, all of which together results in a very thick mucus (the other name of CF is mucoviscidosis). These thick mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, causing fibrosis and cystic dilation of the ducts (hence the name cystic fibrosis). Decreased excretion of pancreatic lipase leads to malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea, which may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Thick mucus may also cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, a condition called meconium ileus. Abnormal mucus in the pulmonary tree leads to atelectasis, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. Obstruction of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles in males leads to sterility, while obstruction of the bile duct produces jaundice.

","Thought:
Opisthotonus posture is a condition where the body is rigid and arched backward, with the head and heels bent backward and the body bowed forward.
This condition is caused by a variety of factors, including neurological disorders, infections, and poisoning.
Strychnous nux vomica contains strychnine, a highly toxic alkaloid that can cause opisthotonus posture by affecting the nervous system.
Action: Answer(""D"")","STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.
