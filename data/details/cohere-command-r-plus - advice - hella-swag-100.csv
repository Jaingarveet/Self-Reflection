Choice A suggests a method of self-reflection and acknowledgment, which can be beneficial.
Choice B suggests writing from a third-person perspective, which can also help in creating distance and objectivity.
Choice C seems unrelated to the topic and doesn't offer a clear therapeutic benefit.
Choice D seems impractical as it may be difficult for someone to draw and write detailed descriptions, and it doesn't add perspective.

  A: swim away in synchronized swim.
  B: stand at the end of the boards in position.
  C: swim over the edge of the diving pool in unison.
  D: dive head to head into the water.
","Thought: 
The sentence begins with ""A female swimmer walks across the diving board,"" indicating that the swimmers are currently on the diving board and suggests that they are preparing for a dive. The use of ""another swimmer"" implies that the two individuals are together and likely performing some sort of routine or synchronized action. While standing at the end of the diving board could be a possibility, it is less likely to be the most immediate action taken. Diving head-to-head into the water is a specific and competitive action that is not suggested by the sentence. Swimming away or over the edge of the pool is unlikely as it interrupts the flow and context of the sentence, which focuses on the diving board. Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is that the swimmers will perform some sort of synchronized action, either diving or swimming, from the diving board.

Answer: Based on the reflection, the correct answer should relate to a synchronized action.

The text advises on how to handle 'frenemies', or friends who may not have our best interests at heart. It suggests confiding in a trusted friend to gain perspective and evaluate the frenemy relationship.

The correct answer should align with this theme and build on the previous step. It should also be cautious and empathetic, reflecting the sensitive nature of interpersonal relationships.

Option A is unrelated to the text's theme and is overly negative. Option C is counter to common sense as it assumes the frenemy will respond honestly, which is unlikely if they have questionable intentions. Option D is cautionary but misses the point of the text, which is to evaluate and understand the frenemy dynamic, not necessarily to end the relationship.

Therefore, the best answer is B, which provides sensible advice to process one's thoughts and emotions regarding the situation, avoiding bitter or resentful feelings. This aligns with the text's theme of navigating tricky relationships with caution and self-reflection.

The text describes a competition involving large men lifting a heavy barbell and receiving scores for their efforts. The most likely completion should reflect what commonly occurs at the end of a competition.

Option A describes a scenario where participants stand, view their scores, and clap. While standing and seeing one's score is reasonable, clapping for oneself is not a common practice.

Option B mentions the declaration of a victor and the posing of the top three men with medals. This completion aligns with common practices at the end of a competition, where winners are celebrated and receive medals.

Option C suggests participants shake hands and salute upon completion of their attempts. Shaking hands is a common gesture, but saluting is not typically done in such a context.

Option D mentions participants walking away and bowing before the barbell goes onto their shoulders. Bowing could signify respect, but it is not a standard practice in this context, and the reference to the barbell going onto their shoulders doesn't align with the preceding actions.

Therefore, option B is the most suitable and socially aligned completion to the text.

The text describes a person who is feeling extreme pressure at work and is considering how to escape this situation. The correct completion to the text should provide practical advice that aligns with the theme of dealing with work-related pressure and criticism.

Choice A: This option provides a quote from Richard Templar, suggesting that by acting as if you don't need the money, you can take back power in a difficult work situation. This advice aligns with the theme of the text and offers a practical strategy for dealing with pressure.

Choice B: While this option continues the discussion about not caring what others say, it lacks the depth and practical advice offered in choice A. It also doesn't provide a clear completion to the text.

Choice C: This option introduces a confusing phrase (""jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl"") that detracts from the main message. It also doesn't provide a clear strategy or completion to the text.

Choice D: While giving notice to someone could be a result of feeling extreme pressure, this option lacks the depth and practical advice offered in choice A. It also doesn't directly complete the text or align with the theme of dealing with criticism.

The text describes the use of natural items as dowsing or divining rods, and the correct answer should provide additional information or instructions that are consistent with this topic.

Choice A mentions using exaggerated branches or canes, which could be a reasonable continuation, but the reference to ""witchcraft"" and ""strings"" seems out of place with the previous focus on natural items and trees.

Choice B offers a specific instruction to look for a particular type of stick with equal-length branches, providing a practical tip that aligns with the topic. It also provides an alternative for those who don't want to use forked sticks, mentioning coat hangers, wire rods, or a pendulum as options, which is a common practice in dowsing.

Choice C suggests buying dowsing rods from a hardware or hunting store, which contradicts the previous sentence about using natural items. The mention of signatures and spells also introduces a new, unrelated concept.

Choice D is irrelevant to the topic and doesn't provide a logical continuation, abruptly shifting to a different task or instruction about square measurements.
