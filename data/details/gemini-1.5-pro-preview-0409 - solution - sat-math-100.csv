","Thought:
The reflection points out the crucial step of checking for extraneous solutions, which arise from squaring both sides of an equation. 
In this case, $x=1$ is extraneous, leaving $x=9$ as the only valid solution.
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","Choice B is correct. Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$ yields $4 x=(x-3)^{2}$, or $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$. Applying the distributive property on the right-hand side of the equation $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$ yields $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$. Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$. Adding 9 to both sides of $0=x-9$ gives $x=9$. Substituting these values for $x$ into the given equation will determine whether they satisfy the equation. Substituting 1 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(1)}=1-3$, or $\sqrt{4}=-2$, which is false. Therefore, $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation. Substituting 9 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(9)}=9-3$ or $\sqrt{36}=6$, which is true. Therefore, $x=9$ satisfies the given equation.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect because $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation: $\sqrt{4 x}$ represents the principal square root of $4 x$, which can't be negative. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because $x=9$ does satisfy the given equation.",B,B,1,539,62,601,
