  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly interpreted the constraint ""The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses"" to mean that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants, regardless of their positions in the row. This led me to choose option C, which requires either the toy store or the veterinarian to be between the two restaurants.
**Correct Answer:** D
**Reasoning:** The correct answer is D: ""No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it."" This constraint effectively ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, as the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. 
**Comparison of Incorrect and Correct Answers:**
* **Incorrect Answer (C):** This constraint allows for the two restaurants to be adjacent, violating the original constraint.
* **Correct Answer (D):** This constraint ensures that the two restaurants are always separated by at least two other businesses, regardless of their positions in the row.
**Key Takeaway:**
It is crucial to carefully analyze the original constraint and consider all possible scenarios to ensure that the chosen alternative constraint has the same effect. 
## Applying Self-Reflection to Current Question
**Question:** Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?
**Choices:**
* A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
* B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
* C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
* D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
* E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
**Analysis:**
* **Option A:** This constraint does not guarantee that the two restaurants will be separated by at least two other businesses.
* **Option B:** This constraint does not address the separation of the two restaurants.
* **Option C:** This constraint is the same as the incorrect answer I previously chose.
* **Option D:** This constraint is the correct answer, as explained above.
* **Option E:** This constraint does not address the separation of the two restaurants.
**Conclusion:**
Based on my self-reflection and analysis, the correct answer is **D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.** This constraint effectively ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, just like the original constraint.

","**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose answer A, which stated that O is placed on a higher shelf than M. However, this is not necessarily true based on the given conditions.
* **Reasoning Error:** I focused solely on the information about O and M being on the same shelf and overlooked the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This led me to incorrectly assume that O must be on a higher shelf than M.
* **Correction:** To avoid this mistake in the future, I will pay closer attention to all the given conditions and consider all possible scenarios before making a choice.
**Answering the Question:**
Based on the given conditions and my self-reflection, I can now analyze the options:
* **A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.** This is not necessarily true. O and M could be on the same shelf (the bottom shelf), or O could be on the middle shelf while M is on the bottom shelf.
* **B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.** This is not necessarily true. K and G could be on the same shelf (the top shelf), or G could be on the middle shelf while K is on the top shelf.
* **C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.** This is **true**. We know I is on the middle shelf, and F must be either on the bottom shelf or the middle shelf (since it's on the same shelf as M). Therefore, I is on a higher shelf than F.
* **D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.** This is not necessarily true. G and O could be on the same shelf (the top shelf), or O could be on the middle shelf while G is on the top shelf.
* **E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.** This is not necessarily true. F and L could be on the same shelf (the bottom shelf), or L could be on the middle shelf while F is on the bottom shelf.

**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider all the rules and constraints. Specifically, I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
**Corrected Approach:**
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all the rules and constraints and then systematically eliminate the answer choices that violate any of them.
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.** This means that Souza cannot be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6.
2. **Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.** This means that Young cannot be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #3.
3. **Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.** This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
**Eliminating Answer Choices:**
* **A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
* **B: Young is assigned parking space #2.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
* **C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
* **D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

* Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
* George can only give a report on Tuesday.
* Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
* If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
**Step 1: Determine the reports for Tuesday.**
* George must give a report on Tuesday.
* Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the other report on Tuesday must be given by either Helen or Irving.
**Step 2: Determine the reports for Monday and Wednesday based on Nina's report.**
* **Case 1: Nina gives a report on Monday.**
    * Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
    * Since George and Helen have already given reports, the remaining reports must be given by Olivia and Robert.
    * Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so Robert must give the afternoon report on Monday.
    * Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday would be Helen, George, and Olivia.

**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: Kayne and Landon
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
* I incorrectly interpreted the constraint ""If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen"" as meaning that Kayne could not be assigned to any ambassadorship.
* This led me to choose the option that included Kayne and Landon, even though it violated the constraint that Landon must be assigned to Zambia.

* I need to pay closer attention to all the constraints and ensure that my interpretation of them is accurate.
* I should not make assumptions about the possible assignments based on limited information.
* It is important to consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate any of the constraints.
## Correct Answer and Explanation
**Correct Answer:** E: Landon and Novetzke
**Explanation:**
* If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen due to the constraint.
* This leaves Kayne and Novetzke as the only remaining candidates for the other two ambassadorships.
* Landon must be assigned to Zambia, leaving Novetzke as the only option for the remaining ambassadorship.
* Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke.

","## Self-Reflection:
**Mistake:** I initially chose answer A as the correct constraint, believing it to be logically equivalent to the original constraint. However, I failed to consider the scenario where Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship but Kayne is not. This scenario is possible under answer A but not under the original constraint.
**Learning:** This mistake highlights the importance of carefully analyzing all possible scenarios when evaluating logical constraints. It is crucial to consider not only the direct implications of a constraint but also its potential interactions with other constraints and variables.
## Applying the Learning:
With this understanding, let's re-evaluate the answer choices:
* **A:** As explained above, this is not logically equivalent to the original constraint.
* **B:** This constraint is completely unrelated to the original constraint and does not influence the assignment of Jaramillo or Kayne.
* **C:** This constraint is the **correct** answer. If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then the original constraint (Jaramillo implies Kayne) becomes irrelevant, and Kayne can be assigned to any ambassadorship without affecting Jaramillo's assignment.
* **D:** This constraint only restricts the assignments of Jaramillo and Novetzke, but it does not have the same effect as the original constraint on the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne.

","## Reflection on Previous Error
My previous analysis was incorrect because I overlooked the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. This led me to incorrectly conclude that K must be the fifth scientist selected.
## Correct Analysis
Given that F, L, Q, and R are already selected, we need to find the fifth scientist that satisfies the following conditions:
* At least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist) must be included.
* If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
* F and K cannot both be selected.
* K and M cannot both be selected.
* If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Since F is already selected, we cannot select K due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. This eliminates options C and D.
Since R is already selected, we cannot select M due to the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. This eliminates option D.
Now, we need to choose between G and H. Since L is already selected, we can select either G or H without violating the condition that at least one scientist of each type must be included. However, if we select G, then we cannot select P due to the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is to select H.
## Conclusion
Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be H.

","## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting **Choice B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**
My initial reasoning was flawed. I focused on the individual conditions and failed to consider the overall constraints. Specifically, I overlooked the fact that at least two books must be placed on each shelf. This led me to incorrectly conclude that G and H could be placed on the same shelf, even though this would violate the constraint of having at least two books on the bottom shelf.
**Correct Answer:**
The correct answer is **Choice C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.**
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
After reflecting on my mistake, I realized that the key to solving this problem is to consider the **relative positions** of the books rather than focusing on individual conditions in isolation.
Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **L is placed on a higher shelf than H:** This means that H cannot be on the bottom shelf.
2. **More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf:** This means that at least three books must be on the bottom shelf.
3. **I is placed on the middle shelf:** This leaves two remaining shelves (top and bottom) for the other seven books.
4. **K is placed on a higher shelf than F:** This means that F cannot be on the top shelf.
5. **O is placed on a higher shelf than L:** This means that L cannot be on the middle shelf.
Combining these conditions, we can deduce the following:
* H cannot be on the bottom shelf (due to condition 1).
* F cannot be on the top shelf (due to condition 4).
* L cannot be on the middle shelf (due to condition 5).
Therefore, the only possible configuration that satisfies all conditions is:
* **Top shelf:** F, G
* **Middle shelf:** H, I, M
* **Bottom shelf:** K, L, O
This configuration places H and M on the same shelf, fulfilling the requirement of the question.

**Reflection:**
* I initially made a mistake because I did not carefully consider all the conditions.
* I assumed that the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, but this is not necessarily true.
* I need to pay close attention to the order of the solos and the types of pieces that are performed.
**Answer:**
Based on the conditions, we know the following:
* The third solo is a traditional piece.
* Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
* In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.
* The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.
* No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then the second solo cannot be a traditional piece. This is because the third solo is a traditional piece, and two traditional pieces cannot be performed consecutively.
Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece. This means that Wayne must have performed the first solo, as he is the only pianist who can perform a modern piece before a traditional piece.
Since Wayne performed the first solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo. This means that Zara must perform the fifth solo.

**My previous answer:** C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
**Reasoning behind the previous answer:**
* I correctly identified that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on the same day.
* I also correctly identified that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
* However, I made a mistake in assuming that the first batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Tuesday. This violated the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
**Learning from the mistake:**
* It is crucial to pay close attention to all the given conditions and ensure that the chosen answer satisfies all of them.
* Double-checking the answer against the conditions can help avoid such mistakes.
## Applying the learnings to solve the current question:
Let's analyze each option:
**A:** This option violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day (Wednesday).
**B:** This option satisfies all the conditions. The second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
**C:** This option violates the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
**D:** This option violates the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on the same day.
**E:** This option satisfies all the conditions. The second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Thursday. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Therefore, the correct answer is either B or E. 
To differentiate between B and E, we need to consider the additional information that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies. This eliminates option B, as it places the first batch of peanut butter cookies on Tuesday.

","**Self-Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose answer choice (A), which stated that Reynaldo tests H on the first day. However, this was incorrect because it did not consider the condition that Theresa must test H.
* **Reasoning:** I focused on the information about Yuki and Seamus, but I overlooked the crucial detail about Theresa.
* **Correction:** To arrive at the correct answer, I needed to consider all the conditions simultaneously and systematically eliminate options that violated any of them.
**Step-by-Step Analysis:**
1. **Theresa tests G on the second day:** This means that G cannot be tested by any other rider on the second day.
2. **Yuki cannot test J:** This eliminates options (B) and (D) because they both involve Yuki testing J on the first day.
3. **Theresa must test H:** This eliminates option (E) because it involves Yuki testing H on the second day, leaving Theresa without a bicycle to test.
4. **The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day:** This means that Yuki cannot test G on the first day (as it is tested by Theresa on the second day) and cannot test H on the first day (as it is tested by Theresa on the second day). Therefore, Yuki must test either F or J on the first day.
5. **Reynaldo cannot test F:** This eliminates option (A) because it involves Reynaldo testing F on the first day.
**Conclusion:**
The only remaining option that satisfies all the conditions is **(C): Theresa tests H on the second day.** This is because it allows Yuki to test F on the first day (which is then tested by Seamus on the second day), and it leaves H available for Theresa to test on the second day.

","I understand the instructions and the context. I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Reflection:**
* I previously made the mistake of assuming that Rottweilers could not be featured on day 7 because they are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. However, this is not necessarily true. Rottweilers could be featured on day 7 if Himalayans are not featured on that day.
* I also made the mistake of assuming that Rottweilers could not be featured on day 3 because they are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. However, this is also not necessarily true. Rottweilers could be featured on day 3 if Himalayans are not featured on that day.
**Answer:**
Based on the given conditions and my previous reflection, the only option that could be true is:
**C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.**
**Explanation:**
* Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. This means they could be featured on days 2, 3, and 4, or days 2, 4, and 5, or days 3, 4, and 6.
* Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means they could be featured on days 1, 5, and 6, or days 1, 3, and 5, or days 1, 4, and 6.
* Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
* No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
The only option that satisfies all of these conditions is:
* Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
* Rottweilers are featured on day 5.
* Greyhounds are featured on day 1.

**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**
1. **Iturbe on Wednesday:** This leaves two remaining slots for Monday and Tuesday.
2. **Jackson on Wednesday:** This leaves one remaining slot for Monday and Tuesday.
3. **Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day:** This means they must be split between Monday and Tuesday.

* We know that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
* We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
* If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, this would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

**Reflection:**
* **Mistake:** I initially chose Image's voicemail target as the 2-day target.
* **Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that Image's voicemail target could be 2 days because it had to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
* **Correct Answer:** Truvest's website target is the only target that can be 2 days.
**Analysis:**
* **Conditions:**
    * None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    * Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    * Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
* **Target Options:**

**Solution:**
1. **Image's voicemail target:** Must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so it cannot be 2 days.
2. **Solide's website target:** Must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so it cannot be 2 days.

**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that since exactly three students review Undulation, Jiang must be one of them. However, this assumption was not supported by the given information.
**Correct Answer:** B
**Reasoning:**
* We know that exactly three students review Undulation.
* We also know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it follows that Megregian must review Undulation.
* Therefore, the remaining two students who review Undulation must be either Jiang and Lopez, or Jiang and O'Neill.
* However, we know that exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. This means that Jiang cannot review Undulation, as this would violate the condition.
* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.

**Previous Incorrect Answer:**
My previous answer was incorrect because I did not fully consider the information provided in the context. I focused too narrowly on the statement about bay 4 holding produce and did not take into account the other relationships between the bays and their cargo.
**Corrected Approach:**
To answer this question correctly, I need to systematically analyze the information provided and identify the bays where the cargo type is definitively determined. Here's my step-by-step approach:
1. **Start with the given information:** Bay 4 holds produce.
2. **Apply the rules:**
    - Grain has a higher number than livestock.
    - Livestock has a higher number than textiles.
    - Produce has a higher number than fuel.
    - Textiles is next to produce.
3. **Analyze the implications:**
    - Since produce is in bay 4, fuel must be in a lower numbered bay (either 1, 2, or 3).
    - Textiles must be in either bay 3 or 5 (next to produce).
    - Livestock cannot be in bay 4 or 5 (due to the relationship with textiles).
    - Grain cannot be in bay 1, 2, or 3 (due to the relationship with fuel and livestock).
4. **Identify definitively determined bays:**
    - Bay 4: Produce (given)
    - Bay 1: Fuel (only remaining option for fuel)
    - Bay 6: Grain (only remaining option for grain)
    - Bay 3: Livestock (only remaining option for livestock, considering its relationship with textiles)
    - Bay 5: Textiles (only remaining option for textiles, considering its relationship with produce)
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the cargo type is definitively determined for five bays: 1 (fuel), 3 (livestock), 4 (produce), 5 (textiles), and 6 (grain).

","I understand. I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.
**Self-reflection:**
* I previously made a mistake in answering this question.
* I did not consider all of the requirements carefully.
* I need to pay more attention to the details of the problem.
**Analysis of the problem:**
* The organizer must select at least five and at most six works.
* The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.
* No more than four French works are selected.
* At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
**Solution:**
The organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian novel. This is because the requirement states that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
The organizer must also select at least three novels. This is because the requirement states that at least three but no more than four novels are selected.
Therefore, the organizer must at least select one French novel and one Russian novel.

* Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
* Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Based on these conditions, let's examine each option:
A: a 1-day website target: This target can be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 1 day or less.
B: a 2-day voicemail target: This target can be set for multiple clients as long as their website target is also 2 days or less.
C: a 2-day website target: This target can be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 2 days or less.
D: a 3-day voicemail target: This target can be set for multiple clients as long as their website target is also 3 days or less.
E: a 3-day website target: This target CANNOT be set for more than one client because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. If both Solide and Truvest have a 3-day website target, this condition would be violated.
Therefore, the target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is a 3-day website target.

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the conditions. I only considered the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. I did not consider the other two conditions.
To answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions.
Here is my step-by-step solution:
1. I will start by considering the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. Then, I will consider the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Finally, I will consider the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

","Thought: 
Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:
1. **Grain > Livestock > Textiles:** This means that Grain is in a higher numbered bay than Livestock, which is in a higher numbered bay than Textiles.
2. **Produce > Fuel:** This means that Produce is in a higher numbered bay than Fuel.
3. **Textiles is next to Produce:** This means that either Textiles is in bay 2 and Produce is in bay 3, or vice versa.
Now, let's consider the options:
* **A: fuel, machinery, textiles:** This violates the ""Grain > Livestock > Textiles"" rule, as Textiles would be in a higher numbered bay than Grain.
* **B: grain, machinery, fuel:** This violates the ""Produce > Fuel"" rule, as Fuel would be in a higher numbered bay than Produce.
* **C: machinery, livestock, fuel:** This violates the ""Grain > Livestock > Textiles"" rule, as Livestock would be in a higher numbered bay than Grain.
* **D: machinery, textiles, fuel:** This violates the ""Textiles is next to Produce"" rule, as Textiles and Fuel would not be next to each other.
* **E: machinery, textiles, produce:** This satisfies all the given conditions:
    * Grain > Livestock > Textiles: Grain could be in bay 4, Livestock in bay 3, and Textiles in bay 2.
    * Produce > Fuel: Produce could be in bay 5 and Fuel in bay 1.
    * Textiles is next to Produce: Textiles is in bay 2 and Produce is in bay 3.

I have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in the future to consider all of the conditions when answering multiple-choice questions.
Thought:
Let's analyze the conditions one by one:
* T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R: This means that T and F or T and R must be adjacent.
* At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F: This means that there must be at least two compositions between F and R.
* O is performed either first or fifth: This means that O can be either the first or the fifth composition performed.
* The eighth composition performed is either L or H: This means that either L or H must be the last composition performed.
* P is performed at some time before S: This means that P must be performed before S.
* At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O: This means that there must be at least one composition between O and S.
Now, let's consider the answer choices:
* A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H: This order does not satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
* B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L: This order satisfies all of the conditions.
* C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H: This order does not satisfy the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
* D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H: This order does not satisfy the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
* E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H: This order does not satisfy the condition that P is performed at some time before S.
Therefore, the only order that satisfies all of the conditions is B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L.
