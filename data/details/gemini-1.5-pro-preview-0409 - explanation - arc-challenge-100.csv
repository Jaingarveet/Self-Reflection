  A: It is made up of more than one substance.
  B: It is impossible to separate the substances.
  C: The components retain their original properties.
  D: The components chemically combine with each other.
","Thought:
The key characteristic of a mixture is that its components retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical means.

Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought:
I recall reflecting on a similar question where I incorrectly chose paper as the most reusable material. 
The correct answer was materials like steel and glass, as they can be recycled multiple times without significant degradation.

Choices:
  A: number of leaves that fall during winter
  B: change in leaf color during the autumn season
  C: type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil
  D: amount of water that is available for growth
","Choices:
  A: number of leaves that fall during winter
  B: change in leaf color during the autumn season
  C: type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil
  D: amount of water that is available for growth
","Thought:
The question asks about inherited traits, which are passed down from parent trees to offspring through genes. 
Options A, B, and D are influenced by environmental factors and are not directly inherited.
The type of mineral absorbed (option C) can be influenced by the tree's genetic makeup, affecting its ability to uptake certain minerals.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Reflection:
I previously chose answer choice C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool. This was incorrect because the introduction of a predator would likely favor the sheep with light wool, as they have some advantage that has allowed them to increase in number despite the strength and size of the dark-wool sheep.

","Thought:
The question asks about a physical change, not a chemical one. 
Option A describes a physical change (formation of a food bolus).
Options B and C involve chemical reactions (breaking down proteins and food substances).
Option D describes a physical process (movement of food).
