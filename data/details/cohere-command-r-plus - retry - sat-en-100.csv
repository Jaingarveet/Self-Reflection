It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is retry because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is retry because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west.

According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave.""

  A: A large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold.
  B: A large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.
  C: A large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","Thought: If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the Venus flytrap will not close.

Therefore, in scenario B, the Venus flytrap will not close around an insect if there is a period of inactivity between the first and second contact, during which calcium ion concentrations diminish.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $B$ is the best answer. The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is retry because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is retry because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",B,B,1,1269,67,1336,

","Thought: The passage states that the fields were left without crops to avoid competition with emerging weeds. This suggests that the presence of crops would have impacted the number of weeds that could grow, and therefore the percentage of the field covered by weeds. As such, the answer is that the percentage would likely have been lower than what Hartmann found without crops.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is retry. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is retry because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control.
