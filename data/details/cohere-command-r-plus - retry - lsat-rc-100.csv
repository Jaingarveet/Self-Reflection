  A: Most of the physical features characteristic of modern humans developed as the result of evolutionary pressures.
  B: Any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation.
  C: To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.

","Thought: 
The author of Passage B would take issue with the assumption that any given human behavior is necessarily driven by a single interest, in this case, the proliferation of genes. This is reflected in choice B.

While Passage A argues that altruism can be explained from an evolutionary standpoint by the presence of shared genetic material, Passage B critiques this by pointing out that other interests could also explain the same behavior. For example, a mother's concern for her child's welfare could be driven by her intrinsic care for the child, not just by the propagation of her genes.

Choice B accurately captures this critical aspect of the author's argument in Passage B.

  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","Thought: The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures. An effective objection to this criticism would be a reason to believe that using Western scientific methods does not distort the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice A suggests that only members of a culture can truly understand and adopt its perspectives and methods. This does not address the issue of whether Western scientific methods can be applied to non-Western cultures without distortion and could even strengthen the criticism by emphasizing the difficulty of truly adopting an outside perspective.

Choice B notes similarities among non-Western value systems, but this does not address the debate over Western scientific methods and does not provide a strong defense of the second version of multicultural education.

Choice C indicates that some non-Western societies use their own value systems when studying other cultures, but this does not directly address the issue of whether Western scientific methods can provide accurate insights without cultural bias.

Choice D discusses the understanding of Western achievements, but this is a separate issue from the criticism, which focuses on the understanding of non-Western cultures.

Choice E emphasizes the importance of genuine understanding but does not provide a counterargument to the criticism that Western scientific methods may be inherently biased and inadequate for understanding non-Western cultures.

The best answer is C: ""Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values."" While this fact does not directly refute the criticism, it suggests that the criticism may be overly simplistic and that a more nuanced approach is required, which is in line with the perspective of the second version of multicultural education.
