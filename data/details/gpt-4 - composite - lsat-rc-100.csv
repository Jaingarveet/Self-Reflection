","Thought: 
The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods for examination. However, it does not advocate for using the theories of one society to criticize another society with different values. Therefore, a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values would be objectionable to these proponents.

","Thought: 
The author's argument is that increased size leads to monopoly power because larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business. This leads to an industry being dominated by a few players, creating a monopoly. 
Choice D suggests that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that not all large businesses will necessarily achieve the scale necessary to drive smaller firms out of business and create a monopoly.

The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers (to the defendant and to the court/society) is that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, nor should they try to prove the innocence of a client they believe to be guilty. Instead, they should present the case in the client's favor as much as possible, while also considering the facts on the other side and arguing for leniency if they believe it is warranted.
