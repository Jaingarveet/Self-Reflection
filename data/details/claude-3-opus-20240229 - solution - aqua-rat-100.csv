","Let's approach this problem systematically:
1) If we use only single letters, we would need 10 letters to uniquely code each type of book.
2) If we use pairs of letters, where the order doesn't matter, then we are dealing with combinations, not permutations.
3) With 4 letters A, B, C, D, we can create the following combinations:
   AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD
   This gives us 6 combinations (4C2 = 6), plus the 4 single letters, for a total of 10 codes.
4) Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed to create 10 unique codes, using either single letters or unordered pairs, is 4.
Action: Answer(""B"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

1. We know the space shuttle's speed is 17.5 m/s. This was calculated correctly in the previous solution.
2. The key insight is that in the 5 seconds it takes for the shuttle to pass a point, it will travel a distance equal to its own length. This is because the front of the shuttle reaches the point, then the back of the shuttle takes 5 seconds to also reach that point.
3. So, to find the length of the shuttle, we need to calculate the distance it travels in 5 seconds:
   * Distance = Speed × Time

1. Calculate the yearly production
   - The company produces 420 units per month
   - Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
2. Calculate the yearly production cost
   - The production cost per unit is $110
   - Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400
3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost to get the total revenue needed
   - They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400
   - Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
   - Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
4. Divide the total revenue needed by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit
   - Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   - Minimum selling price per unit = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.2857... per unit

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the reflection:
1) The height of the tower is h and the car's uniform speed is v. 
   The initial distance of the car from the tower base is x.
2) Initially, tan(45°) = h/x, so x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   So √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) For the remaining distance y:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   So the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying 10√3(√3 - 1):
   10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(√3 - 1) 
Comparing this to the answer choices, we see that 10(√3 - 1) matches choice C: 10(√3 - 1).
Action: Answer(""C"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

3) We are asked to find the maximum value of P(neither A nor B), which is equivalent to P(not A and not B).
4) By the addition rule:

1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:
   
   Area of square = side × side = 20 × 20 = 400 cm²
2) Two semicircles are cut out from this square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So the radius of each semicircle is 10 cm.
3) The area of a semicircle is given by the formula: (π × r²) / 2, where r is the radius.
   
   Area of semicircle = (π × 10²) / 2 = 50π cm²
4) There are two semicircles, so the total area cut out is:
   
   Area cut out = 2 × 50π = 100π cm²
5) The remaining area of the paper is the area of the square minus the area cut out:
   
   Remaining area = 400 - 100π ≈ 85.84 cm²

1. Let's assume Arjun has 'x' dollars and Sajal has 'y' dollars.
2. According to the first condition:
   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   Mathematically, y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
   Simplifying, y + 30 = 2x - 60
   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)
3. According to the second condition:
   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
   Simplifying, x + 10 = 3y - 30
   x = 3y - 40 ... (Equation 2)
4. Substitute the value of y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
   x = 6x - 270 - 40
   x = 6x - 310
   5x = 310
   x = 62
5. Now, substitute x = 62 into Equation 1:
   y = 2(62) - 90
   y = 124 - 90
   y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.
2. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph. 
3. To find the speed of the current, we can use the formula:
   Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed
   2 = 4 - x
   Solving for x:
   x = 4 - 2 = 2
   So the speed of the current is 2 kmph.
4. Now to find the man's speed along the current, we use:
   Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed
                            = 4 + 2 = 6
Therefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.

","Here is my thought process and solution:
1) If B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC.
   Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
2) Since the total of a circle is 360°, and minor arc AC is 160°, major arc AC must be:
   Major arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°
3) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc AC. 
   Major arc AB = 200° / 2 = 100°
4) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
5) Since points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of the circle, D must be between B and C.
6) To find minor arc AD, we need to add minor arc AB and minor arc BD.
   Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD 
                = 80° + 150°  
                = 230°
However, the question asks for minor arc AD, which cannot be greater than 180°. Therefore, the answer must be the reflex angle 360° - 230° = 130°.
Action: Answer(""B"")","B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees. Now , we have arc BD = 150, therefore CD = 70.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
Given information:
- The team won 20 matches
- The team lost 30% of their matches
To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches played.
First, let's find the total number of matches:
- They won 20 matches
- And those 20 wins represent 70% of the total (since they lost 30%)
To find the total, we can divide the number of wins by the percentage of matches won:
Total matches = Wins / Percentage of matches won
              = 20 / 0.7
              = 28.57
Rounding up, the total number of matches is 29.
Now, to find the number of losses, calculate 30% of 29:
Losses = 30% of total matches
       = 0.3 × 29 
       = 8.7
Rounding up, the number of matches lost is 9.

1) Let p = number of pita breads, r = number of rolls, b = number of baguettes
2) From the given information:
   6p = 2r (six pita breads equal two rolls)
   3r = 5b (three rolls equal five baguettes)
3) We want to find x such that xp = 2b
4) From the first equation: r = 3p
   Substituting into the second equation:
   3(3p) = 5b
   9p = 5b
5) Now, we have xp = 2b and 9p = 5b. Solving for x:
   xp = 2b
   x(9p) = x(5b)
   9xp = 10b
   9x = 10
   x = 10/9
6) So, 10/9 pita breads equal 1 baguette.
   The question asks for the number of pita breads equal to 2 baguettes.
   Therefore, we multiply 10/9 by 2:
   (10/9) * 2 = 20/9 ≈ 2.22

1) We're given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Let's find the bounds on x by plugging in the min and max values of n.
2) When n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2*√36*(36+4) + 16) / (36 + 4*√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 2*6*40 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)
     = (1296 + 480 + 16) / 64

3) When n = 72:
   x = (72^2 + 2*√72*(72+4) + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
     = (5184 + 2*8.485*76 + 16) / (72 + 33.941 + 4)
     = (5184 + 1289.76 + 16) / 109.941
     = 6489.76 / 109.941
