  D: Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned. 40
","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passages and analyzing the language used, I realized that the central tension between the two passages is not about economic impact or popular support, but rather the moral and ethical implications of slavery. Douglas argues that the Constitution allows for the expansion of slavery, while Lincoln believes that this goes against the moral principles upon which the country was founded.

Douglas: ""It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory.""

Lincoln: ""It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again when the Nebraska Bill was passed.""

In these passages, Douglas highlights the peaceful coexistence of slavery within the existing borders of the United States, while Lincoln emphasizes the historical context of the Missouri Compromise and the Nebraska Bill, which allowed for the expansion of slavery into new territories. This central tension between the two passages is the driving force behind their differing opinions on the matter.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",,C,0,1397,289,1686,

Question: It can be inferred that the authors of Passage 1 believe that running a household and raising children

Choices:

A: are rewarding for men as well as for women.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the authors of Passage 1 believe that running a household and raising children entail very few activities that are difficult or unpleasant. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually suggests the opposite. The authors argue that women's roles in the home are essential to the common happiness of both men and women, and that women's delicate constitutions and peaceful inclinations make them better suited for these roles. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 state that women should seek ""gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" so they can avoid performing difficult, or ""strenuous,"" and unpleasant, or ""onerous,"" tasks.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors of Passage 1 do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require professional or political skills.",B,C,0,1424,196,1620,

Upon reviewing the passage, I realized that I incorrectly selected option A, ""similar to many of their peers,"" as the answer to the question. After analyzing the text, I have come to understand that the narrator actually portrays the Quabarl children as unusually creative and intelligent.

The passage highlights their unique personalities and interests, such as Claude's love for poetry and Wilfrid's talent for music. Irene is described as having an artistic temperament, and Viola is introduced as someone of a mould ""equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."" These details suggest that the Quabarl children are not ordinary or typical of their peers, but rather exceptional and distinctive.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option B, ""unusually creative and intelligent.""

Answer: (B) Unusually creative and intelligent.","Choice A is the best answer. Lady Carlotta learns about Mrs. Quabarl's children Claude, Wilfrid, and Irene (lines 53-58). The narrator then describes Mrs. Quabarl's child Viola as ""something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century"" (lines 58-61). This statement about Viola implies that all of the Quabarl children have skills typical, or ""of a mould equally commonplace,"" to other peers in their social class.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the narrator does not indicate that all of the Quabarl children are unusually creative and intelligent, hostile to the idea of having a governess, or more educated than their peers.",,A,0,1512,215,1727,

The experiment used microneurography to measure the nerve signals in response to gentle brushing and pressure, which helped the researchers understand the characteristics of CT fibers and their role in conveying a different dimension of sensory information. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.

Self-Reflection:
I realized that I misunderstood the goal of the experiment in 1999 and mistakenly selected choice (C). I also noticed that the experiment used microneurography to measure nerve signals, which further supports the conclusion that the goal of the experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations conveyed by CT fibers.

Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this ""civilization"" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

The central claim of the passage is:

C: the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.

Explanation:
The passage argues that the procession of educated men has been a male-dominated institution, and that this monopoly on power has had significant effects on society. The author suggests that women have been excluded from this procession and have had to find other ways to engage with power, such as through domestic work and childrearing. The passage also implies that the male-dominated nature of this procession has contributed to the perpetuation of inequality and the lack of representation of women's perspectives in society. Therefore, the central claim of the passage is that the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

I previously answered question A, which states that an experiment is proposed but proves unworkable; a less ambitious experiment is attempted, and it yields data that give rise to a new set of questions. However, upon re-reading the passage, I realized that the correct answer is B, which states that a new discovery leads to reconsideration of a theory; a classic study is adapted, and the results are summarized.

The passage describes how Ken Dial made a new discovery about how young birds learn to fly, which led him to reconsider the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate. He designed an experiment to measure the clues that might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly, and he found that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively. This discovery led him to adapt a classic study and summarize the results, which formed the basis of his new hypothesis.

Reflection:

During my initial answer, I mistakenly selected option A. Upon reviewing my response, I realized that the correct pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question is option C: $17.3 \%$ and $32.8 \%$.

The reasoning behind this answer is as follows:

* The table shows that sea urchin DNA contains 17.3% adenine, 17.7% guanine, 25.7% cytosine, and 32.1% thymine.
* The question asks which pair of base percentages in sea urchin DNA provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question.
* The correct answer is option C, as the combination of 17.3% adenine and 32.8% thymine provides the most support for the answer to the previous question.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer because it gives the percentage of cytosine (17.3\%) in sea urchin DNA and the percentage of guanine (17.7\%) in sea urchin DNA.

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Question: Throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is

Answer: B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Explanation: The narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing everything around her, and reflecting on it later. She is attuned to the dark wood floors, clean glass cases, and the sounds of the inksticks being rotated in the light. This suggests that she is observant and detail-oriented, which is consistent with the choice B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage.

Reflection:
I previously answered choice (A) The corrupting influence of a materialistic society as the best description of a major theme in the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that materialism is a major theme. Instead, it highlights the growth and development of Eppie and Silas' relationship, as well as the impact of Eppie's presence on Silas' life.

Therefore, the best description of a major theme in the passage is choice (C) The bittersweet brevity of childhood naïveté. The passage shows how Eppie's childhood and innocence bring joy and new experiences to Silas' life, but also highlights the inevitability of Eppie growing up and losing her innocence. This theme is evident in the passage's descriptions of Eppie's growth and development, as well as Silas' reactions to these changes.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom."" But after adopting Eppie, Silas became more interested in life outside his job: ""Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life."" A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

Question: In Passage 2, the author claims that freedoms granted by society's leaders have

Choices:

A: privileged one gender over the other.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly as option A. Upon reflection, I realized that the author is actually arguing that the lack of freedoms granted by society's leaders has resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue. The author contends that women are excluded from political rights and functions, which hinders their ability to comprehend their duty and contribute to the moral and civil interest of mankind. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue.

Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. In lines 72-78, Wollstonecraft argues that the laws passed by society's leaders allow men to ""contend for their freedom"" but serve to ""subjugate women."" In this context, ""subjugate"" means to control. Wollstonecraft is arguing that society's leaders grant men freedoms that are denied to women.Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Wollstonecraft does not claim that society's leaders have granted freedoms that created a general reduction in individual virtue, caused arguments about happiness, or ensured equality for all people.",B,A,0,1404,169,1573,

Reflection:

Initial Answer: I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the percentage of surface covered with weeds would be higher than Hartmann's original prediction. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the information provided in the passage. The passage suggests that the method of plowing at night can minimize the germination of weed seeds, which would result in a lower percentage of surface covered with weeds. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.

[REDACTED]

The passage provides evidence to support the idea that plowing at night can minimize the germination of weed seeds. The authors of the passage present data from an experiment conducted by Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, which showed that weed growth was greater in samples stirred up in light than in samples stirred up in darkness. This suggests that the method of plowing at night can reduce the number of weed seeds that germinate, which would result in a lower percentage of surface covered with weeds. Additionally, the passage notes that hundreds of millions of photons strike each square millimeter of ground each second, even under conditions where the photon fluence rate is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second. This suggests that even brief exposure to sunlight can stimulate the germination of weed seeds, which could contribute to a higher percentage of surface covered with weeds if plowing were conducted during the day. However, the passage does not provide any information that would suggest the opposite is true, i.e., that plowing at night would result in a higher percentage of surface covered with weeds. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",B,A,0,1662,397,2059,

  D: Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.
","  Reflection:

After re-reading Passage 2, I realized that Grimké's central claim is D: Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish. Grimké argues that since rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman. She believes that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do, as their duties originate from the diversity of their relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to their care, and the different eras in which they live.

Grimké's argument is based on the idea that moral rights are not determined by race or gender, but rather by the inherent dignity and worth of individuals as moral beings. She rejects the notion that men have higher rights and responsibilities than women based solely on their sex, and instead argues that both men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish and fulfill their moral duties.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66).

I previously answered choice (C) nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed, but upon further analysis, I realized that the passage does not support this answer. The passage states that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect of sensation. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.

Self-Reflection:
I reviewed the passage and identified the key points that led me to the correct answer. I noticed that the passage mentions that CT fibers are sensitive to gentle stimulation and are only found in hairy skin, which suggests that they are responsible for conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers. I also observed that the passage highlights the difference in brain activity between normal subjects and G.L., indicating that CT fibers are involved in emotional processing. Finally, I realized that choice (D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored is the best answer based on the information provided in the passage.","Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",,B,0,1575,222,1797,

I misinterpreted Akira's tone and language, attributing a lack of sincerity to his proposal.

I previously answered question D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Passage 2 presents a more nuanced view of the Filipino people's resistance to American imperialism. The passage acknowledges that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans to resist foreign domination and that the American government's policy of imperialism would be met with protest and resistance.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: deceptive, since the American government's true goal of economic domination would be masked by a rhetoric of liberation and self-governance. Bryan would likely criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance as being insincere and motivated by self-interest, rather than a genuine desire to promote liberty and self-governance in the island territories.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind? I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Explanation:
The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere nothing for the books he buys, because Sempere won't take his money. This is evident when the narrator says, ""He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left."" This suggests that the narrator is not paying Sempere for the books he buys, but rather leaving the coins on the counter as a way of showing his appreciation for the books he receives.","Choice $D$ is the best answer.

These lines signal the narrator's awareness that he was paying less for the books than they were worth.Choice A is incorrect because the passage states that Sempere didn't expect or want the narrator to pay: ""He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books."" Choice B is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that even if Sempere didn't want the narrator's money, the narrator would still ""leave the coins I'd managed to collect.""

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: The speed with which they climbed. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is option C: The alternation of wing and foot movement.

The passage explains that the baby Chukars were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb steep ramps. The birds were flapping their wings while running up the ramp, and this alternation of wing and foot movement allowed them to gain traction and climb more efficiently. This is supported by the observation that the birds were able to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life, which suggests that they were using a coordinated movement of their wings and legs to do so.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: The alternation of wing and foot movement.

I previously answered question A, which states that a character's arrival at her family's ink shop sparks fond memories of her favorite aunt.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice (C) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (A) Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.

Ken Dial's research focused on understanding how young birds learn to fly, and he designed his experiments to observe how baby game birds learned to take short hops into the air. He noticed that young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators. They only used the ground for feeding and traveling.

Based on this observation, Ken assumed that young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. He tested this assumption by providing hay bales for the Chukars to perch on, and the results showed that the baby Chukars were using their legs to climb up the hay bales instead of flapping their wings to fly up to the perches.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research, which is that young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.","Choice $A$ is the best answer.

Reflection:
I previously answered question 70 incorrectly, selecting option A: has renounced all desire for money. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option B: better understands his place in nature.

The passage highlights how Silas' adoption of Eppie has led to a change in his perspective on life. He is no longer fixated on the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web, but instead, he is drawn to the beauty of nature and the changing seasons. The passage states, ""And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers"" (70). This suggests that Silas is now more interested in exploring the natural world and spending time with Eppie, rather than focusing solely on his work.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: better understands his place in nature.

Answer: (B) Better understands his place in nature.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator indicates that with the arrival of Eppie, Silas's thoughts turn from his work and his gold toward Eppie's future and his life with her: ""Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit - carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years."" By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage explains that Silas spends time outdoors after the arrival of Eppie, there is no indication that her presence has necessarily changed his understanding of his place in nature.

Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four down the middle. The decoration was art moderne, except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears. While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France. A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie. The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, ""I didn't think you were coming."" Time is probably no more unkind to sporting characters than it is to other people, but physical decay unsustained by respectability is somehow more noticeable. Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button. Apparently he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

Answer: B: an exchange between strangers to a satisfying personal relationship.

Explanation:
Throughout the passage, the primary focus shifts from Lymie's inner thoughts to observations made by the other characters. The passage describes the interactions between Lymie and the other patrons of the restaurant, including the waitress Irma, the plenipotentiaries at the Congress of Vienna, and the two men and two women who come into the restaurant. The passage also highlights the personal relationships between these characters, such as the bond between Mr. Peters and the young man who is always by his side. The passage does not focus on the physical setting of the restaurant or the different characters' personality traits, but rather on the interactions and relationships between the characters.","Choice D is the best answer. The passage begins with the main character, Lymie, sitting in a restaurant and reading a history book. The first paragraph describes the book in front of him (""Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body,"" lines 1113). The second paragraph reveals what Lymie is reading about (the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienn(A)and suggests his intense concentration on the book (""sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating,"" lines 23-24). In the third paragraph, the focus of the passage shifts to a description and discussion of others in the restaurant, namely ""A party of four, two men and two women..."" (lines 42-43).Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage does not provide observations made by other characters, only offering Lymie's and the narrator's observations.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option C: divine gift to the American people. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually supports option B: replication of conditions in Europe.

In Passage 1, Beveridge highlights the vast resources and immensity of the United States, which he believes make it a unique and powerful nation. He argues that the United States has a divine destiny to spread its influence and institutions across the world, much like European empires have done in the past. This suggests that Beveridge sees the United States as a replication of conditions in Europe, with the added twist of divine intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: replication of conditions in Europe.

Answer: B","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge portrays America as ""a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe.""

Context: Passage 1

Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?

Answer: (B) Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.

Reflection:

In Passage 1, Tocqueville and Mill have different views on the factors that determine an individual's proper position in society. Tocqueville suggests that society should be organized in a way that allows individuals to fulfill their respective roles based on their sex, with men and women having different spheres of activity. Mill, on the other hand, argues that an individual's abilities and capacities should determine their position in society, regardless of their sex.

Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer, as Tocqueville's view is that an individual's position should be determined by their economic class, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",,A,0,1528,244,1772,

I previously answered question 45 incorrectly, selecting option A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage does not support this answer. The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold. This suggests that option C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open is the correct answer.

The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant.

The author notes that they have looked at the procession from a distance for years, but now they are part of it themselves, and this realization makes a difference. The bridge serves as a symbol of the continuity of this legacy and the author's place within it.

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Question: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident. The narrator's encounter with Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a pivotal moment in the passage, as it marks the beginning of the narrator's obsession with reading and his desire to become a writer. The passage highlights the impact that this book had on the narrator's life, as he read it repeatedly and became convinced that he wanted to do the same thing as Mr. Dickens. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) depiction of the narrator's father.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",B,A,0,1318,988,2306,

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B: They will be valuable only if they can be harvested cheaply. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.

The passage in Passage 1 highlights the potential value of resources such as water, iron, silicon, and aluminum, which are abundant in the moon's poles and asteroids. These resources are likely to be highly valued in space due to their scarcity and versatility. The passage also mentions the potential for water to be used as a radiation shield or for drinking, which further supports the idea that water will be a valuable resource in space.

In contrast, Passage 2 highlights the potential for other resources such as platinum, gold, and rare earth elements to be highly valued in space. The passage notes that these resources could be used in space-based projects, such as 3D printing, and that they may increase in value as they become scarce on Earth.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet.

However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect. The information about X-ray evidence and density is actually used to support the authors' claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA, not to establish the identity of the genetic molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) confirm the relationship between the density of DNA and the known chemical formula of DNA.

Self-Reflection:

During the initial answer, I misunderstood the context of the passage and misinterpreted the authors' purpose. I realized that the passage is discussing the structure of DNA and the authors are using the X-ray evidence and density to support their claims about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA. I also realized that the information about X-ray evidence and density is not directly related to the identity of the genetic molecule.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 12-14 the authors claim that DNA molecules appear to be comprised of two chains, even though ""it has often been assumed ... there would be only one"" (lines 15-17). The authors support this claim with evidence compiled from an X-ray: ""the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two [chains]"" (lines 18-19).Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors mention density and X-ray evidence to support a claim, not to establish that DNA carries genetic information, present a hypothesis about the composition of a nucleotide, or confirm a relationship between the density and chemical formula of DNA.",D,C,0,1604,261,1865,

  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
","  Reflection:

Initial Answer: I initially answered the question incorrectly, selecting option A, ""Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model was actually in line with their proposed mechanism. Volkov demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, and he showed that the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close can be determined.

Correct Answer: Based on the passage, the potential criticism that might be made of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is option B, ""Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model."" While Volkov's experiment supported the overall mechanism proposed by Hodick and Sievers, it is possible that his measurements did not fully align with the specific details of their model.

Explanation: Volkov's experiment demonstrated that electricity is necessary for the Venus flytrap to close, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. However, it is possible that there are other aspects of their model that Volkov's experiment did not fully test or corroborate. For example, Volkov did not directly measure the concentration of calcium ions in the trap, which is a key component of Hodick and Sievers's model. Therefore, while Volkov's experiment supported the overall mechanism proposed by Hodick and Sievers, it is possible that there are still some aspects of their model that require further testing or refinement.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate whether the technology Volkov used had been available to Hodick and Sievers when they formulated their model.",,B,0,1426,363,1789,

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Question: Throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is

Answer: B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Explanation: The narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing everything around her, and reflecting on it later. She is attuned to the dark wood floors, clean glass cases, and the sounds of the inksticks being rotated in the light. This suggests that she is observant and detail-oriented, which is consistent with the choice B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen."" She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family's ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before. Choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the narrator isn't portrayed as sympathetic to the needs of others (choice (C)or anxious about her responsibilities (choice D).",,B,0,1395,1096,2491,

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option A: founding and history of the United States. However, upon further reflection, I realize that both Beveridge and Bryan's arguments focus more on the idealism and principles of American society, rather than its historical foundations.

Beveridge emphasizes the importance of liberty and the role of the United States as a beacon of hope for oppressed peoples around the world. He uses phrases such as ""the propagandists and not the misers of liberty"" and ""a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century"" to convey the idea that America's greatness lies in its commitment to freedom and democracy.

Similarly, Bryan highlights the moral obligation of the United States to support the cause of independence for the Filipino people. He argues that the Republican party should take a clear stance on the issue and defend its position, but acknowledges that the subject races will resist foreign domination to the extent of their ability. Bryan's use of phrases such as ""God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty"" and ""a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred"" suggest that he views American imperialism as a threat to the very principles that the United States was founded upon.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: idealism that permeates many aspects of American society. Both Beveridge and Bryan's arguments are centered around the idea that America's greatness lies in its commitment to democratic ideals and its role as a champion of freedom and justice around the world.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge expresses admiration for the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society, but Bryan doesn't.",,A,0,1417,362,1779,

  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered question 45 incorrectly, selecting choice (C) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Lincoln would most likely agree with choice (B) - It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.

Lincoln's speech Passage 2 highlights the idea that the controversy over slavery has been exacerbated by attempts to spread it into new territory. He argues that the peace and stability of the Union have been maintained when slavery has been limited to its current bounds, and that the trouble and convulsion have proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. This suggests that Lincoln believes that ending the controversy over slavery would be possible if attempts to introduce it into new regions were abandoned.

In contrast, choice (A) suggests that the controversy over slavery can only be ended through unilateral action by Northern states to abolish slavery throughout the United States. However, Lincoln's speech suggests that this approach would not be effective in resolving the controversy, as it would only lead to further division and conflict.

Similarly, choice (C) suggests that the controversy over slavery has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves. While it is true that the legal framework surrounding slavery has been complex and confusing, Lincoln's speech suggests that the real source of the controversy is the attempt to spread slavery into new territory.

Finally, choice (D) suggests that the controversy over slavery is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state. While it is true that there have been cultural and religious differences between the North and South, Lincoln's speech suggests that these differences are not the primary source of the controversy over slavery. Rather, it is the attempt to spread slavery into new territory that has led to the conflict.

In conclusion, based on Lincoln's speech in Passage 2, he would most likely agree with choice (B) - It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned. This approach aligns with Lincoln's belief that the controversy over slavery can only be resolved through peaceful means, such as limiting its expansion into new territory, rather than through unilateral action by Northern states.","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Lincoln never attributes the controversy over slavery to differences in religion or social values from one state to another.",,B,0,1389,514,1903,

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.

  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question as follows:

""B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not support this answer. The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, but it does not suggest that conserving calcium reserves is a significant advantage of the plant's requirement for multiple triggers. In fact, the passage suggests the opposite, as it states that the plant's calcium reserves are depleted when the trap closes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

Explanation:
The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a certain time frame (twenty seconds) in order to close its trap. This is because the plant's calcium reserves are depleted over time, and the trap will not close if the second trigger hair is not touched within the specified time frame. This ensures that the plant captures its prey before closing its trap, preventing it from missing its opportunity to feed.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",,C,0,1383,256,1639,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B: criticize a tradition. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as stated in option C. The passage describes Akira's unexpected arrival and proposal to Chie, and Chie's amusement and confusion at the situation. The author does not criticize the tradition of arranged marriages or Akira's actions, but rather presents the situation as a curious and unexpected event. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: question a suggestion.

Answer: The main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, so the correct answer is option C: question a suggestion.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage.

Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals.
