  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
","Thought: 
The original price of the computer is $x$.
After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.
An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is $p$ dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
The original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$. However, this is incorrect because $8 \%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$.

","Following the provided instructions and reflection:
1. Mean of List A: (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 21/6 = 3.5
2. Mean of List B: (2+3+3+4+4+5)/6 = 21/6 = 3.5
3. Standard Deviation of List A: 
   - Calculate the squared deviations from the mean for each element in List A.
   - Sum the squared deviations.
   - Divide the sum by the number of elements in List A minus 1.
   - Take the square root of the result.
   - Standard Deviation of List A ≈ 1.71
4. Standard Deviation of List B: 
   - Following the same steps as for List A, the Standard Deviation of List B ≈ 0.83
Comparison:
- The means of List A and List B are the same (3.5).
- The standard deviations of List A and List B are different (1.71 and 0.83).
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice A is correct. The mean number of each list is found by dividing the sum of all the numbers in each list by the count of the numbers in each list. The mean of list $A$ is $\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=3.5$, and the mean of list $B$ is $\frac{2+3+3+4+4+5}{6}=3.5$. Thus, the means are the same. The standard deviations can be compared by inspecting the distances of the numbers in each list from the mean. List A contains two numbers that are 0.5 from the mean, two numbers that are 1.5 from the mean, and two numbers that are 2.5 from the mean. List B contains four numbers that are 0.5 from the mean and two numbers that are 1.5 from the mean. Overall, list B contains numbers that are closer to the mean than are the numbers in list $A$, so the standard deviations of the lists are different.Choice $B$ is incorrect and may result from assuming that two data sets with the same mean must also have the same standard deviation. Choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect and may result from an error in calculating the means.",C,A,0,770,238,1008,

It's given that the helicopter's initial height is 40 feet above the ground and that when the helicopter's altitude begins to increase, it increases at a rate of 21 feet per second. Therefore, the altitude gain $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins rising is represented by the expression $21 t$.

This is the helicopter's altitude above the ground 1 second after it began to gain altitude, not $t$ seconds after it began to gain altitude. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because adding the expression $-21 t$ makes this function represent a decrease in altitude.
