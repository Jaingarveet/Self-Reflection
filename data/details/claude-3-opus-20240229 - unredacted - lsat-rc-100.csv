  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","You're right, I need to more fully consider the implications of the critics' perspective described in the third paragraph. Let me take another look at this.
The key points about the critics' view are:
1) They believe real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting that culture's own perspectives and methods. 
2) They object to examining cultures through the lens of Western scientific methods and values, seeing it as distorting and Eurocentric.
3) Many non-Western cultures prize myth, tradition, religion and mystical insight over the objectivity and empiricism valued by Western science.
Given this, the critics would likely object to any study that uses the theories, methods or values of one culture to examine or judge another culture, especially if that other culture has very different values.
Looking at the choices again with this fuller perspective:
A and B describe comparative studies but don't necessarily involve one culture's standards being used to judge another. 
C refers to using Western methods to study a nonscientific culture, which the critics object to, but there's a more direct answer.
E is about critiquing Western culture itself, which isn't the critics' concern.
D directly describes using one society's theories to criticize another society's literature. This is a clear case of the kind of cross-cultural judgment the critics in paragraph 3 would object to, as it involves evaluating one culture by another's standards.
Therefore, the best answer is D, as it most completely represents what the passage indicates the critics would find objectionable.

","You're right, upon re-reading the passage carefully, it's clear that while three positions are introduced, Dostoyevsky's third position is differentiated primarily from the second, radical position in detail. The first position is only mentioned briefly without much elaboration.
The passage spends several paragraphs explaining how Dostoyevsky's view differs from the radical critics' perspective on the purpose and nature of art and literature. In contrast, the first position that art should stand above everyday reality is not analyzed in depth.
So the key structural point is that the passage presents Dostoyevsky's position as a contrast to the radical view, going into detail about their differences, while the first position is more of a brief setup without the same level of detailed treatment.

","You're right, upon further reflection I see that Choice D is the best answer here. Let's think through this step-by-step:
The author asserts in lines 11-16 that Toni Morrison was the first African American author to use a musical genre (jazz) as the structuring principle for an entire novel in her 1992 book Jazz. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This supports the author's assertion rather than calling it into question. Eliminate.
B) While this suggests earlier African American novelists used musical structures, it specifies blues music rather than jazz. It doesn't directly challenge Morrison being the first to use jazz structure. Eliminate.
C) This is overly broad, referring to all novels about nonliterary arts, not specifically African American novels or use of musical structure. Eliminate. 
D) This choice suggests that any novel can be considered somewhat musical, especially if read aloud. It implies that the musical qualities Morrison employed may be inherent to novels in general, rather than a unique innovation. While it doesn't definitively disprove the author's assertion, it invites doubt about Morrison's technique being a groundbreaking ""first"". Keep as a potential best answer.
E) This is largely irrelevant to the author's assertion, as it's about subject matter (music as a topic) rather than structural influence. Eliminate.
After this analysis, Choice D emerges as the best answer. It effectively calls into question the author's assertion about the uniqueness of Morrison's use of musical structure, without contradicting it outright.

  D: Fingerprint identification should not be considered to have a low error rate Wlless rigorously conducted tests have shown this to be so.
  E: Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards iffingerprint identification is to be reliable.
","Thought process:
Both passages discuss the lack of uniform, objective standards in fingerprint examination and identification. This is the key principle underlying their arguments:
Passage A acknowledges there are no generally accepted standards on the number of matching points required to declare a fingerprint match. However, it argues this is outweighed by fingerprinting's long history of use in trials, which demonstrates its underlying reliability. 
Passage B argues fingerprint evidence is unreliable precisely because examiners lack objective standards for declaring a match, with practices varying between jurisdictions. It states the value of fingerprint evidence can't be properly assessed without data on how likely partial prints from different people are to match.
So while the passages reach different conclusions, they share the fundamental premise that objective standards are necessary to consider fingerprint evidence reliable. Passage A believes the current lack of fully uniform standards is not disqualifying, while Passage B sees it as a critical flaw undermining fingerprint evidence.
Looking at the answer choices:
A is incorrect - this captures Passage A's argument but not the principle shared by both.
B is incorrect - neither passage focuses on defendants' rights.
C matches a detail discussed in Passage B, but is not the core principle motivating both passages' arguments.
D is incorrect - it matches Passage B's conclusion but not the premise shared with Passage A.
E best captures the key principle underlying both passages - that objective standards are needed for fingerprint identification to be reliable. The passages build different arguments on this foundation, but it is the common thread between them.

  D: The development of innovative marketing strategies will ensure acceptance of the new digital model.
  E: Widespread familiarily with new ways of storing information will be the primary reason for the acceptance of the new digital model.
","You're right, I need to focus more carefully on the author's central argument about what will drive the transition to the digital publishing model.
The key points are:
1) Under digital publishing, many traditional costs are eliminated, so authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. 
2) Literary agents could thus be expected to demand significantly higher royalties for authors than has been traditional.
3) To accommodate these higher royalty demands, traditional publishers will have to reduce redundant functions or else lose authors to digital-only publishers. 
4) This pressure from literary agents for higher royalties is described as the driving force that will push traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model.
So the author's main argument is that the demands of literary agents for higher author royalties, enabled by the cost efficiencies of digital publishing, will be the primary impetus for the publishing industry's transition to the digital model. The passage emphasizes this as the key factor, more so than things like changing consumer tastes or ease of keeping works in print.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice C - that the demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.

","Thought process:
Passage A focuses specifically on a defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence in his own criminal case. It discusses the defendant's claims about the lack of testing, error rates, and objective standards for fingerprint identification. However, the court ultimately rejects the defendant's arguments, finding fingerprint evidence reliable based on its long history of use and the testimony of the fingerprint examiner in this specific case.
In contrast, Passage B takes a broader view of issues with fingerprint identification as a whole. It points out the general lack of consensus on matching standards, the unknown probability of different people sharing identifying characteristics, and the dearth of systematic study on error rates in the field. Passage B does not focus on any one specific court case, but rather discusses these issues as they apply to fingerprint identification in general.
Compared to Passage A, Passage B is more general in its focus. While Passage A looks at fingerprint evidence in the context of one specific case, Passage B examines overarching issues with fingerprint identification that apply across the field, not just to a single case.

","Based on the self-reflection, the key is to focus on the fundamental implication about the nature of proverbs themselves, rather than getting sidetracked by supporting details.
The passage defines a proverb as ""a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context"" but also states that ""Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.""
This most directly supports answer choice D: ""There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs."" 
The other choices focus on how proverbs relate to ethnicity or compare Mexican American proverb usage to other communities. While the passage mentions these points, they are not the main implication.

Lines 7-11: ""Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation.""
This sentence reports the view of some legal scholars that lawyers should always provide the best possible defense for their clients, regardless of the lawyer's own opinion about the client's guilt or innocence.
Lines 28-31: ""In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent.""
Here, the author expresses their own opinion that lawyers should only try to prove a client's innocence if the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent. This implies the author believes lawyers should not attempt to prove innocence if they believe the client is guilty.
The author's opinion in lines 28-31 clearly disagrees with the view reported in lines 7-11.

  E: present an example of the high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses the contradiction between the Invisible Hand (which assumes diminishing returns and perfect competition) and the Pin Factory (which involves increasing returns and a tendency towards monopoly). 
2. Economists historically focused more on the Invisible Hand concept because diminishing returns were easier to model mathematically than increasing returns.
3. The railroad industry is mentioned as an example of an industry characterized by increasing returns, which aligns with the Pin Factory concept. 
4. By providing railroads as an example, the author is illustrating that many real-world industries exhibit increasing returns, even though this contradicts the assumptions of the Invisible Hand.
5. Therefore, the emphasis on the Invisible Hand in economic thought has shortcomings, as it fails to account for industries like railroads that have increasing returns.
Looking at the answer choices:
A and B are incorrect because the railroad example is not used to resolve ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor or illustrate the difficulty of mathematically modeling the Pin Factory.
C is close, but not the best answer, as the railroad example does more than just call attention to the prevalence of increasing returns industries.
E is incorrect because the passage does not suggest railroads have high levels of competition.
D is the best answer. The railroad example specifically points to an industry that contradicts the assumptions of the Invisible Hand, thus illustrating the shortcomings of overemphasizing that concept in economic thought.

","You're right, upon further reflection answer choice A provides the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education presented in the passage.
The key point of the criticism is that genuine understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting that culture's own internal perspectives and methods, rather than studying it through the lens of Western scientific methods. The criticism argues that using external Western methods is distorting and a form of cultural chauvinism.
Answer A directly challenges this by claiming that it is impossible to truly adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. If this is correct, then the criticism's proposed solution of studying cultures using their own methods to gain ""real understanding"" is actually infeasible. 
This strikes at the heart of the criticism and suggests its central claim is flawed, since the internal cultural understanding it calls for is impossible for outsiders to attain. Thus, A undermines the criticism more fundamentally than any of the other choices by challenging the very possibility of its conclusion.
