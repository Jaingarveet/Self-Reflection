The question asks what one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was. The passage states that the experiment sought to address the question of whether CT fibers could convey a pleasant sensation and that the researchers tested this by brushing a patient's arm gently to activate CT fibers. It also mentions that the researchers used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when the patient's arm was brushed.

Option B is also retry because while the passage discusses the effects of downdrafts on birds and airplanes, this is not the main focus of the passage.

The passage states that fast fibers were believed to be responsible for transmitting information about location, and blocking them would eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. This suggests that the blocking of fast fibers would not result in an increase in the rate at which other nerve fibers fired (choice A), or the perception of gentle stimuli as painful (choice B). It also suggests that the body would not compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure (choice C), as this would not be necessary if fast fibers were still functioning.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired. The passage states that fast fibers were believed to be responsible for transmitting information about location, and blocking them would eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. This suggests that fast fibers are necessary for the perception of vibrations, and blocking them would impair this ability.

It's worth noting that the passage does not explicitly state that the ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired, but it can be inferred based on the information provided.","Choice D is the best answer.

The correct answer is B: are matters of deeply entrenched tradition.

In Passage 2, Mill argues that gender roles are resistant to change because they have been deeply ingrained in society for a long time and are connected to strong emotions.

","  Action: Answer(""A"")

The passage suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, did not include means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states. The author argues that the Constitution, which Mr. Lincoln thinks is contrary to the law of God, has stood despite the division between free and slave states. The author suggests that the Union can exist forever, divided into free and slave states, if each state carries out the principles upon which their institutions were founded, such as the right of each state to do as it pleases without meddling with its neighbors. Therefore, option A is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

The main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States in the first paragraph of Passage 1 is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.

Action: Answer(""A"")

The authors in both passages argue that changes in gender roles are necessary and beneficial for society. In Passage 1, the author argues that the social changes that bring men and women closer to equal status will raise women and make them more equal to men. In Passage 2, the author argues that society has outgrown the old state of inequality and is substituting a just equality as the general principle of human relations. Both authors see the changes in gender roles as part of a broad social shift toward greater equality. Therefore, the correct answer is A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general. This can be seen in the first paragraph of Passage 1, where Tocqueville explains that raising woman to be ""more and more the equal of man"" is part of the overall ""social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant,"" and in the first paragraph of Passage 2, where Mill writes that ""mankind have outgrown"" the state of inequality and ""now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality,"" with gender roles being the last of these relations to undergo such a shift.Choice B is retry because although in Passage 1 Tocqueville argues that there are costs to treating men and women the same, in Passage 2 Mill characterizes gender equality as a source of benefits only. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because neither author considers changing gender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead on questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people's potential.

When they enter the ink shop, they are hesitant to approach their father and uncles, and it takes them a while to warm up to the idea of sitting down and being served tea. The narrator also seems to be observant and attentive to detail, noticing the appearance and cleanliness of the shop, as well as the quality of the inksticks and other items on display. They are also shown to be respectful and polite, addressing their father and uncles with formal language and following proper etiquette.
Therefore, the best answer is A: reserved around unfamiliar people.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is retry because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is retry because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is retry because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",,A,0,1396,208,1604,

","  Topic: English
Context: The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves. Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,  and reopening the trap can take several hours, soDionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring thetrap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.We can look at this system as analogous to short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the information (forms the memory) that something (it doesn't know what) has touched one of its hairs. Then it stores this information for a number of 20 seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves this information (recalls the memory) once a second hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against25 the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of the information, doesn't close, and the anthappily meanders on. How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it30 remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?Scientists have been puzzled by these questions ever since John Burdon-Sanderson's early report on the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882 . A35 century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.40 In their studies, they discovered that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential [a temporary reversal in the electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this 45 coupling of action potentials and the opening of calcium channels is similar to the processes that occur during communication between human neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to 55 push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of 60 calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.65 Subsequent research supports this model. Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close. To test the model they rigged up very fine70 electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while they didn't measure calcium levels, the current likely led to increases). When they modified this 75 experiment by altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. As long as fourteen microcoulombs-a tiny bit more than the static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons80 together-flowed between the two electrodes, the trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open

The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.""

Answer:  B

Explanation:
In Passage 2, Bryan argues that the idea of American governance of island territories, as presented by Beveridge in Passage 1, is problematic. Bryan suggests that the vision of American governance is deceptive since it would be motivated by a desire for economic domination rather than a genuine interest in the welfare of the islanders. Therefore, the best answer is (B) deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.

In Passage 1, Beveridge presents a vision of American governance of island territories as a means of spreading liberty and civilization. However, Bryan challenges this vision in Passage 2, arguing that it is not a genuine attempt to promote the welfare of the islanders but rather a veiled attempt at economic domination. Bryan suggests that the islanders would resist such a policy, and that it would ultimately undermine the principles of self-government that the United States was founded upon.

Therefore, option (B) deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government, is the best answer. Options (A) unrealistic, (C) impractical, and (D) naive do not accurately reflect Bryan's criticism of Beveridge's vision as presented in Passage 2.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines. However, in the first paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan warns, ""If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ... must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are retry because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",,D,0,1459,536,1995,

The question asks which conclusion is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment. The correct answer is option C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

In the 1993 experiment, Olausson and his colleagues used microneurography to measure nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips. They showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers - about 1 meter/second - confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. This discovery confirmed that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

Therefore, option C is the best answer. Options A, B, and D are not supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. According to the passage, different types of nerve fibers carry signals at different speeds, either fast or slow.

Olausson and his team found that ""soft stroking prompted two different signals"" in test subjects' nerve fibers, ""one immediate and one delayed.""

","  The answer is A: do not produce pyrethrums.

The authors assume that clover does not produce pyrethrums, which are natural insecticides that can help protect honey bees from mites. This assumption is based on the fact that pyrethrums are produced by certain species of the Chrysanthemum genus, and clover is not a member of this genus. Therefore, the authors believe that clover is unlikely to contain pyrethrums and may not provide the same level of protection against mites as pyrethrum-producing plants.

The other choices are not correct assumptions that the authors make about clover. Choice B is retry because clover is not a member of the Chrysanthemum genus, which includes pyrethrum-producing plants. Choice C is also retry because the location of clover plants near wild-type honey bee colonies is not relevant to the authors' assumption about clover.

Beecher states that women are to win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved, and that their influence is to be accomplished in the domestic and social circle.

The passage states that G.L. differed from Olausson's other test subjects in terms of the effect of MRI scanning on the basic function of brain cortices. According to the passage, when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm to activate CT fibers, only the insular cortex, which processes emotion, was active, whereas in normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated. This suggests that G.L.'s brain responded differently to gentle brushing due to the unique functioning of her slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers, which convey a more emotional quality of touch.

  D: No, because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
","  The answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.

The table shows that for all four pathogens, the percentage of colonies infected is higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder. This suggests that infection with these pathogens may contribute to colony collapse disorder. Since varroa mites can increase a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections, it is reasonable to infer that infection with varroa mites increases the likelihood of colonies undergoing colony collapse disorder. Therefore, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim.

Choice A is retry because the data do not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder. Instead, the data show a correlation between pathogen infection and colony collapse disorder, which suggests that pathogen infection may be a factor in colony collapse disorder, but does not necessarily cause it.

Choice C is retry because the data do provide evidence about the occurrence of pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. While the data do not provide information about bacteria specifically, they do show that viruses, IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, and Nosema ceranae are present in colonies with colony collapse disorder at a higher frequency than in colonies without colony collapse disorder.

Choice D is retry because the data do not indicate whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.

","  Based on the passage, the best answer is (B) Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

According to the passage, Hodick and Sievers's model proposes that the Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and that a second touch is needed to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap. Volkov's experiment involved applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, which caused the trap to close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs. While this experiment supported the idea that electricity plays a role in the closure of the Venus flytrap, it did not directly test the specific mechanism proposed by Hodick and Sievers.

Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer, as Volkov's measurements did not directly corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model, which is the idea that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close and that a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is retry because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:
Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States. Beveridge's passage highlights the nobility of the land given by God, the people's imperial destiny, and the glorious history bestowed upon the chosen people. Bryan's passage references the speech of Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Washington, and Lincoln, all of which are significant figures in American history. The passages demonstrate admiration for the founding principles and history of the United States, making choice A the correct answer.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is retry because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't. Choice D is retry because Beveridge expresses admiration for the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society, but Bryan doesn't.",A,A,1,1418,321,1739,

  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  D: They expend more energy than do ibises.
","  Answer: C

The passage implies that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in a V formation to save energy during migration. The author mentions that smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult, suggesting that larger birds like pelicans, storks, and geese are better suited for flying in a V formation. However, the author does not provide any information about the specific communication methods or migration routes of these birds, so options A and B are not implied. Option D is also not implied, as the passage does not mention anything about the energy expenditure of these birds compared to ibises. Therefore, the best answer is C, as it accurately summarizes the implied information about pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. At the beginning of the fifth paragraph the passage states that ""the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult."" In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is retry because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication. Choices B and D are retry because the passage discusses pelicans, storks, and geese only with respect to their drafting behavior, not in terms of their migration routes or how much energy they might expend when flying.",,C,0,1368,179,1547,

  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","  Based on Passage 2, Lincoln would be most likely to agree with claim B: It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.

In Passage 2, Lincoln states that the controversy over slavery has been caused by efforts to spread it into new territory, and that whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, there has been peace. He suggests that the solution to the controversy is to limit slavery to its current boundaries and not attempt to spread it further. This is in line with claim B, which states that the controversy would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.

Therefore, the answer is B: It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is retry because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is retry because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry because Lincoln never attributes the controversy over slavery to differences in religion or social values from one state to another.",,B,0,1390,178,1568,

Reflection:
[REDACTED]

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is retry because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is retry because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is retry because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",D,C,0,1384,34,1418,

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","  Answer: B

Beveridge presents liberty as an exemplary concept that justifies conquest, whereas Bryan warns that imperial expansion would undermine its exemplary quality.

In Passage 1, Beveridge describes the United States as a ""greater England with a nobler destiny"" and emphasizes the country's ""heaven-directed purposes."" He suggests that the United States has a divine mandate to expand its territory and spread its institutions to other countries. Beveridge presents liberty as a central aspect of American identity, but he also suggests that it is a gift that the United States can bestow upon other nations.

In contrast, Bryan argues in Passage 2 that the principles of self-government and liberty are not something that can be imposed upon other nations through conquest. He warns that if the United States were to pursue a policy of imperialism, it would undermine the very principles that make the country great. Bryan presents liberty as a fundamental right that all people possess, and he suggests that it is not something that can be given or taken away by any government.

Therefore, the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty is that Beveridge sees it as something that the United States can and should spread to other countries, while Bryan sees it as a fundamental right that all people possess and that cannot be imposed through conquest.

Answer: B","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is retry because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is retry because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is retry because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",,B,0,1527,312,1839,
