Explanation:
The answer choice C best reflects the main argument of the critics. They argue that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. This is because the values of one culture cannot be adequately understood if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. The other answer choices do not accurately reflect the main argument of the critics. For example, answer choice A is too extreme and does not accurately reflect the critics' argument. Answer choice B is a general statement that does not address the main argument of the critics.

The author's main argument is that the new digital model of publishing will eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing due to its economic efficiency and convenience for customers. The author provides evidence that the digital model eliminates the costs of warehousing, shipping, and displaying physical books, making it much less expensive than traditional publishing. The author also argues that authors will be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds under the digital model, which will lead to competition between traditional and digital publishing firms.

The answer choice that most directly supports the author's main argument is B: The ease of keeping books ""in print"" will be the primary factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model. This choice directly relates to the author's argument that the digital model allows for books to be easily printed and bound on demand, eliminating the need for physical inventory and making it more convenient for customers.

","Thought:
The author of passage B criticizes the argument made in passage A by suggesting that it is a mistake to assume that any given behavior can be explained solely by an interest in propagating one's genes. The author argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a particular behavior, and that it is necessary to show that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had a particular interest in order to make a decisive explanation.

The keywords in the question that indicate the author's criticism are ""mistaken assumption"" and ""arguments like that made in passage A.""

Answer choice A is incorrect because it does not directly address the author's criticism. The author does not dispute the idea that physical features characteristic of modern humans developed as a result of evolutionary pressures.

Answer choice B is incorrect because it goes too far in suggesting that all actions performed by early humans were necessarily orchestrated by their genes. The author of passage B does not dispute the idea that genes play a role in behavior, but rather argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a particular behavior.

Answer choice C is the correct answer. The author of passage B criticizes the argument made in passage A by suggesting that it is a mistake to assume that showing that a behavior would have improved reproductive success is sufficient to explain the behavior in evolutionary terms. The author argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a particular behavior, and that it is necessary to show that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had a particular interest in order to make a decisive explanation.

Answer choice D is incorrect because it is not relevant to the author's criticism. The author of passage B does not suggest that evolutionary psychology can be used to explain human behavior but not animal behavior.

Answer choice E is incorrect because it does not directly address the author's criticism. The author does not dispute the idea that behaviors that significantly hindered reproductive success were eliminated by evolutionary competition.

The author's primary purpose in the passage is to analyze the structure of Toni Morrison's novel ""Jazz"" and how it relates to the musical genre of jazz. The author discusses how Morrison uses a narrative structure that is analogous to a jazz band, with the narrator acting as the composer and conductor, and the characters' voices acting as the individual musicians' solos. The author also draws a comparison between Morrison's use of this structure and Duke Ellington's approach to composing for his musicians.

","Thought:
The author of passage A argues that law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators. This power is exercised frequently to reduce the costs of overinclusion, which occurs when rules of law forbid some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid. The author suggests that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.

The plan described in passage B involves selectively cutting off water to a few residences with outstanding bills in high-income neighborhoods to show that officials are serious about collecting debts. However, the author of passage A would likely argue that this plan is an example of overinclusive enforcement, as it targets a group of people who may not have intentionally violated the law.

The author of passage A would be most likely to agree with statement D, which suggests placing liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills. This approach would reduce the costs of overinclusion by targeting only those who have intentionally violated the law, rather than punishing a group of people who may not have intended to violate the law.

Upon re-reading the passage, I realized that the specific criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version because it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden, to study other cultures. This approach is seen as distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
Choice C directly addresses the specific criticism by suggesting that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. This implies that it is possible to study and understand other cultures without relying solely on Western scientific methods, which counters the criticism that the second version of multicultural education is not genuinely multicultural.
