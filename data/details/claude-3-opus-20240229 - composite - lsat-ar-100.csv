  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
","Okay, let's carefully analyze this problem step-by-step:
The fixed constraints are:
- Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday 
- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday
- Hong does not testify on Monday
- At least 1 witness testifies on Monday
Now let's examine each answer choice:
A) Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
This is possible without violating constraints. For example: 
Monday: Franco
Tuesday: Garcia, Jackson  
Wednesday: Iturbe, Hong
B) Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.
This is not possible. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, and if Franco testifies on Wednesday too, then Garcia would have to testify on Wednesday as well (since Franco and Garcia can't be on the same day). But that would leave only 2 witnesses for Monday and Tuesday combined, violating the ""at least 1 on Monday"" and ""exactly 2 on Tuesday"" constraints.
C) Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
This works. For example:
Monday: Franco 
Tuesday: Garcia, Hong
Wednesday: Iturbe, Jackson
D) Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
This is possible. For example:
Monday: Garcia
Tuesday: Franco, Jackson
Wednesday: Iturbe, Hong
E) Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
This violates the constraint of exactly 2 witnesses testifying on Tuesday. If Jackson is on Tuesday and 2 are on Monday, that only leaves 1 other witness for Tuesday.
Therefore, the choice that CANNOT be true is B.

  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least two spaces between the restaurants.
2. With seven spaces total, this allows for the following possible locations of the restaurants:
   - Spaces 1 and 4 (or 4 and 7) 
   - Spaces 1 and 5 (or 3 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 6 (or 2 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 7
3. Now let's consider each answer choice:
   A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5. 
      This restricts a restaurant to the middle spaces, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.
   B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
      This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.
   C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants. 
      This is not equivalent. Even if the toy store or vet is between the restaurants, it doesn't guarantee at least two businesses separate them.
   D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
      This is equivalent to the original constraint. If no more than two businesses separate the pharmacy and nearest restaurant, then the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
   E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
      This is unrelated to the separation of the restaurants.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D. Substituting the original constraint with ""No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it"" would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses.

  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.
  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.
  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We are given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
2. The rules state:
   - Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. 
   - Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young.
   - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Young must be lower than Robertson, the only options for Young are space #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa must be lower than Young, and Young is in #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces.
5. Therefore, we can definitively say:
   - If Young is in space #2, Togowa must be in space #1. 
   - If Young is in space #1, Togowa must be in space #2.
6. The question asks what must be true if Robertson is in space #3. Looking at the answer choices, only E matches our definite determinations. It states ""Young is assigned parking space #2.""
7. We can confirm this logically: 
   - Robertson in #3 means Young must be in #2 (the only lower space).
   - Young in #2 means Togowa must be in #1 (the only lower space than #2).
Therefore, the correct answer is E: Young must be assigned parking space #2.

  A: Rebecca
  B: Olivia
  C: Nessa

","Okay, let's carefully work through this step-by-step, considering each constraint:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's.
5. Lan does not lead a Wednesday session (given in the question).
From constraint 5, we know Lan must lead either a Thursday or Friday session. 
From constraint 2, this means Olivia must lead a Wednesday session.
From constraint 4, Julio must therefore lead a Wednesday morning session.
So the Wednesday sessions are assigned:
- Morning: Julio 
- Afternoon: Olivia
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session (constraint 3), and Wednesday and Thursday are the only options left, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
Kevin and Rebecca must lead on the same day (constraint 1), which must be Thursday since Wednesday and Friday are fully assigned.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, Kevin must lead a Thursday session.

  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the given information and the advice from the reflection:
1. I is fixed on the middle shelf.
2. F and M must be together on either the middle or bottom shelf, since they are on the same shelf.
3. K must be on a higher shelf than F and M. So K is either on the top or middle shelf.
4. O is on a higher shelf than L. L cannot be on the top shelf then, so L must be on either the middle or bottom shelf.
5. Since more books are on the bottom than the top, the bottom must have at least 3 books, the middle at least 2, and the top exactly 2.
6. The only consistent arrangement given these constraints is:
   - Top shelf: K and O
   - Middle shelf: I and 1 other book 
   - Bottom shelf: F, M, L and at least 1 other book
7. In this arrangement, O is on the top shelf while M is on the bottom shelf with F.

  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.
  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. There are only three plays in total: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation. This is a key piece of information.
2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian must review at least 2 plays, possibly all 3.
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So the play(s) Jiang reviews must be different from the ones Megregian and Lopez review.
4. Since there are only 3 plays total, and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, that leaves at most 1 play that Jiang could possibly review. 
5. Therefore, Megregian necessarily reviews more plays than Jiang. Jiang can review 1 play at most, while Megregian reviews at least 2.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This is not necessarily true. Jiang and Lopez could each review 1 play.

","Okay, let's carefully go through this problem step-by-step, listing out all the conditions and checking each answer choice against them:
Conditions:
1. Exactly six students will give reports over 3 days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). 
2. Two reports per day, one morning and one afternoon.
3. George can only report on Tuesday.
4. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
5. If Nina reports, then the next day Helen and Irving must both report, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
Now let's check each answer choice:
A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert 
   Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving
   Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle
   - Violates condition 4 because Robert gives an afternoon report.
B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia
   Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle 
   Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore
   - Violates condition 5. Nina reports Wednesday, but Helen and Irving report on Tuesday, not Thursday.
C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen
   Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle
   Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
   - Satisfies all conditions. George reports on Tuesday, Olivia and Robert have morning slots, and Nina does not report so condition 5 does not apply.
D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen
   Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving
   Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore 
   - Violates condition 4 because Olivia has an afternoon slot.
E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina
   Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen
   Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George
   - Violates conditions 3 (George reports on Wednesday instead of Tuesday) and 4 (Olivia has an afternoon slot).
After checking all choices, only C satisfies all the given conditions. Let me double check that:
- 6 students report: Lenore, Helen, George, Kyle, Robert, Irving 
- 2 per day, 1 AM 1 PM: Yes
- George on Tues: Yes
- No Olivia or Robert PM: Yes 
- Nina rule: N/A
Therefore, the correct answer is C.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, but we don't know in what order.
2. George can only report on Tuesday, so he must give the Tuesday afternoon report.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they report at all, it must be in the morning.
4. If Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report the next day. If Nina reports on Wednesday, this condition doesn't apply.
5. Since Helen gives a morning report, she cannot report on Wednesday morning. If she did, that would mean Nina reported on Tuesday, requiring Helen to report again on Wednesday, which is not possible.
6. So Helen must report on either Monday or Tuesday morning. 
7. If Helen reported on Tuesday morning, then Irving would have to report on Wednesday (due to the condition about Nina). But the question states that Helen, Kyle and Lenore give the morning reports. So Helen can't report on Tuesday morning.
8. Therefore, Helen must report on Monday morning. 
9. This means that if Nina reports, it must be on Monday afternoon, so that Irving can report on Tuesday morning.
10. In this scenario, Kyle and Lenore would report on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings, in some order.
So the correct answer is that Irving must give a report on Tuesday.

","Okay, let's carefully work through this step-by-step, considering all the conditions:
1. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports. That leaves George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert as potential presenters.
2. George can only present on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
3. The key condition is: If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
4. Let's start scheduling:
   - George must present on Tuesday, either morning or afternoon. Let's tentatively put him Tuesday afternoon.
   - Olivia and Robert can only present in the morning. Let's schedule Olivia for Monday morning and Robert for Tuesday morning.
5. Now considering Nina's condition:
   - If Nina presents Monday, then Helen and Irving must present Tuesday. But George must present Tuesday, so this doesn't work.
   - If Nina presents Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must present Wednesday. This could work.
   - If Nina presents Wednesday, then the condition doesn't apply. This could also work.
6. The only way to satisfy all conditions is:
   - Monday morning: Olivia
   - Monday afternoon: Nina
   - Tuesday morning: Robert
   - Tuesday afternoon: George
   - Wednesday morning: Irving
   - Wednesday afternoon: Helen

2. One of the conditions is that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
3. Another condition is that if M (a chemist) is selected, then both P and R (two zoologists) must be selected. 
4. If we select M, that would require selecting both P and R. But that would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected.
5. Therefore, M cannot be selected if both G and H are selected. 
6. The only remaining options for the chemist are F and K. However, the conditions state that F and K cannot both be selected.

Given conditions:
- Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday.
- Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
- George must give a report on Tuesday (the only day he can).
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
Step 1: Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Tuesday is the only day George can report, George must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Step 2: Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. The condition states that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Helen is already giving a report on Wednesday afternoon, Irving must give the morning report on Wednesday. 
Step 3: For Monday, the only remaining students who can give the morning report are Lenore, Nina, Olivia and Robert. Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, he must give the morning report on Monday.
Therefore, the morning reports are given by:
Monday: Robert
Tuesday: George 
Wednesday: Irving

  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
","Okay, let's carefully consider each answer choice and see which one is logically equivalent to the original constraint: ""If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.""
A) ""If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo."" 
This is the contrapositive of the original statement. However, it changes the meaning. The original allows Kayne to be assigned without Jaramillo, but this forces Jaramillo to be assigned whenever Kayne is. Not equivalent.
B) ""If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.""
This is completely irrelevant to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne. Eliminate.
C) ""If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.""
Again, this has nothing to do with the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne's assignments. Irrelevant.
D) ""Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.""
This captures the key implication of the original constraint. If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must be assigned, which means Novetzke cannot be (since Kayne and Novetzke can't both be assigned). So Jaramillo and Novetzke will never both be assigned, just like the original constraint implies. This has the same effect.
E) ""Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.""
Irrelevant to the original Jaramillo/Kayne constraint. Eliminate.
After analyzing each choice, D is the only one that is logically equivalent to the original constraint in terms of its implications and effects on the ambassador assignments.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all possibilities that satisfy the conditions:
1. If G is fourth, then J must be first, second, or third (since J must be earlier than G).
2. R must be fifth, sixth, or seventh (since R must be later than G). 
3. S must be earlier than Y.
4. Consecutive articles can't cover the same topic. So H can't be adjacent to J or G.

A: H is fifth. This is possible. For example: J, S, Y, G, H, Q, R satisfies all conditions.
B: J is first. This is possible. The example order in (A) has J first.
C: Q is second. This is not possible. If Q is second, then S cannot be earlier than Q (given condition). But S must be earlier than Y. There's no way to arrange S, Q and Y satisfying both conditions.
D: S is fifth. This is not possible. S must be earlier than Y. If S is fifth, Y must be sixth or seventh. But then R cannot be after G and before Y.

1. The third solo must be a traditional piece, but it could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Two traditional pieces must be performed consecutively. This could be either the 2nd and 3rd solos, or the 3rd and 4th solos. 
3. For the 4th solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. So if the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform the 4th solo.
4. No traditional piece can be performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. But this doesn't require Wayne to perform any traditional pieces, just that he must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is played.
5. So a possible scenario that satisfies all conditions is:
   - 1st solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
   - 2nd solo: Zara performs a modern piece 
   - 3rd solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - 4th solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - 5th solo: Wayne performs a modern piece

Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is zero.

1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review it. 
3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So if Megregian reviews Tamerlane, it's possible that neither Kramer nor Lopez review it. But we know Kramer does review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This allows for more than two students to review a single play, as long as only two of them review an identical set of plays overall.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. Jiang, Kramer - This violates the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
B. Kramer, O'Neill - This satisfies the conditions we know so far, but we need to check the other choices.
C. Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill - This violates the condition that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, since Megregian would have to review Tamerlane and at least one other play.
D. Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill - This satisfies all the conditions. Megregian reviews Tamerlane and at least one other play, satisfying the condition that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
E. Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill - This violates the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.

3. F is placed on the same shelf as M. And K is placed on a higher shelf than F. 
4. Since H is on the bottom shelf, and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, F and M cannot be on the bottom shelf (otherwise the bottom shelf would have 4 books, which is more than the total of O and L on the top shelf).
5. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I. And K must be on the top shelf with O and L.
6. This leaves G to be placed on the bottom shelf with H.

  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
","Okay, let's carefully analyze this step-by-step given that Theresa tests J on the first day:
1. If Theresa tests J on the first day, she must test H on the second day to satisfy the condition that she tests H on one of the days.
2. Yuki cannot test J at all. So on the first day, Yuki must test either F, G, or H. 
3. Whichever bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, Seamus must test that same bicycle on the second day.
4. If Yuki tested H on the first day, Seamus would have to test H on the second day. But this is impossible because Theresa must test H on the second day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.
5. Let's consider the two possible scenarios:
   Scenario 1: Yuki tests F on the first day
   - First day: Theresa tests J, Yuki tests F, Seamus tests H, Reynaldo tests G
   - Second day: Theresa tests H, Yuki tests G, Seamus tests F, Reynaldo tests J
   This satisfies all conditions.
   Scenario 2: Yuki tests G on the first day
   - First day: Theresa tests J, Yuki tests G, Seamus tests H, Reynaldo tests F
   - Second day: Theresa tests H, Yuki tests F, Seamus tests G, Reynaldo tests J
   But this violates the condition that Reynaldo cannot test F. So this scenario is impossible.
6. Therefore, the only possible scenario is Scenario 1.
7. Looking at the answer choices:
   A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. - This is false in the valid scenario.
   B: Seamus tests H on the first day. - This is true in the valid scenario.

A: The optometrist is in space 5.
This is possible. We could have:

This satisfies all constraints.
B: The pharmacy is in space 1.
This is also possible. For example:
1 - Pharmacy, 2 - Shoe store, 3 - Optometrist, 4 - Toy store, 5 - Veterinarian, 6 - Restaurant, 7 - Restaurant
All constraints are met.
C: A restaurant is in space 3.
This could be true. A possible arrangement is:

D: The toy store is in space 6.

All requirements are fulfilled.
E: The veterinarian is in space 4.
This is possible too. Here's an arrangement:
1 - Pharmacy, 2 - Shoe store, 3 - Optometrist, 4 - Veterinarian, 5 - Toy store, 6 - Restaurant, 7 - Restaurant

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J. 
2. Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
3. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
4. We are told Theresa tests G on the second day. So she must test H on the first day to satisfy condition 2.
5. Yuki cannot test J on the first day (condition 1). So he must test either F or G on the first day.
6. If Yuki tests F on the first day, then per condition 3, Seamus must test F on the second day. This would leave Reynaldo to test J on the first day and H on the second day. But Reynaldo testing H on the second day violates the condition that Theresa must test H.
7. Therefore, Yuki must test G on the first day. Per condition 3, Seamus will then test G on the second day. 
8. This leaves Reynaldo to test J on the first day and F on the second day, satisfying all conditions.
9. In this scenario, Yuki tests G on the first day and Seamus tests G on the second day.
Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, Seamus must test G on the second day.

  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Y is in position 4. This means positions 3 and 5 cannot be about wildlife.
2. S must be earlier than Y. So S can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. 
3. If S is in position 3, then Q must be in position 1 or 2 (because S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third).
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Now let's consider the possibilities:
- If S is in position 1:
  - H must be in position 2 to avoid consecutive nutrition articles
  - J must be in position 3 to avoid consecutive finance articles and be before G
  - This satisfies all conditions
- If S is in position 2: 
  - Q must be in position 1 to avoid S being earlier than Q when Q is not third
  - J must be in position 3 for the same reasons as above
  - This also satisfies all conditions
- If S is in position 3:
  - Q must be in position 1 or 2
  - But then either G or H must be in position 5, violating the condition that G must be earlier than R
Therefore, the only valid possibilities are S in position 1 or 2, and in both cases, J must be in position 3.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be on days 2, 6 or 7. This eliminates choice A.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1 or 7. So they must be on 3 of days 2-6. 
3. Rottweilers can't be on the same day as Himalayans or on day 7.
4. If Rottweilers were only on day 3 (choice D), then Himalayans could be on days 2, 4, 5 and/or 6. This satisfies all constraints so far.
5. If Rottweilers were on day 6 (choice C), Himalayans would have to be on 2, 3, 4 and/or 5. But this would mean Rottweilers are featured more than once, contradicting choice C itself. So C is not possible.
6. Choice B doesn't specify anything about Rottweilers or Himalayans, so it could be true without contradiction.
7. If Rottweilers were on exactly 3 days (choice E), that only leaves 1 day for Newfoundlands and 1 for Siamese, but we need 2 days for each. So E is not possible.
Therefore, only choice D, ""Rottweilers are featured only on day 3"", is consistent with Himalayans not being featured on day 7. Both A and C lead to contradictions, while B and E don't provide enough information to determine if they are possible or not.

1. Reynaldo cannot test bicycle F on either day. This eliminates choice B (Seamus tests F on the first day), as Reynaldo would have to test F on the second day in this case.
2. Yuki cannot test bicycle J on either day. 
3. Theresa must test bicycle H on one of the two days. Let's consider both possibilities:
   a) If Theresa tests H on the first day, then one of Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki must test H on the second day to satisfy the condition that all bicycles are tested each day. This means Theresa cannot test any other bicycle, including F, on the second day.
   b) If Theresa tests H on the second day, then she clearly cannot test F on the second day.
4. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. This doesn't directly affect whether Theresa can test F on the second day.

2. One of the conditions states that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
3. Since Image's website target is 2 days, its voicemail target must be either 2 days or 1 day to satisfy this condition.
4. Another condition states that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
5. If Image's voicemail target were 1 day, it would satisfy the condition of being shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. However, it would violate the condition that no client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.
6. Therefore, the only way to satisfy both conditions is for Image's voicemail target to also be 2 days. 
7. If Image's voicemail target were 1 day, it would contradict the condition that no client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.

8. Therefore, the only possible locations for grain are bay 4, 5, or 6.
9. The question asks which cargo type CANNOT be in bay 4. Grain CAN be in bay 4, so grain is not the correct answer.
10. Machinery is not mentioned in the ordering rules, so it could be in any bay, including bay 4. Machinery is not the correct answer.
11. Produce must be next to textiles. The only way it could be in bay 4 is if textiles are in bay 3 or bay 5. But if textiles are in bay 5, there's no room for livestock and grain in the correct order. So produce CANNOT be in bay 4.

A) Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
This can be true. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned (to Venezuela or Yemen) based on the second constraint.
B) Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
This can be true. If Kayne is assigned to Zambia, then Jaramillo could be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen, satisfying all constraints.
C) Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
This CANNOT be true. The first constraint states that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned. If Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne cannot be assigned at all. However, the fourth constraint says that if Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia. This would mean neither Kayne nor Novetzke could be assigned, violating the first constraint.
D) Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
This can be true. The constraints do not require Landon to be assigned.
E) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
This can be true. The constraints do not require Ong to be assigned.
Therefore, after carefully considering each choice against the given constraints, the answer that CANNOT be true is choice C. Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia without violating the constraints.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We are told Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This is our starting point.
2. One constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. Since Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo must also be assigned an ambassadorship.
3. Another constraint says that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. But we know Kayne is assigned to Yemen, so Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
4. We also know that if Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. But Ong is the only person left who could be assigned to Zambia, so Landon cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.
5. By process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. Ong must be assigned to Zambia.
Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.

Given:

- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
Step 1: Determine Stuckey and Udall's zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both. 
- Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
Step 2: Determine Mahr's zone.
- Mahr works in the same zone as Stuckey.
- Stuckey works in Zone 3.
- Therefore, Mahr also works in Zone 3.
Step 3: Determine possible zones for the remaining representatives.
- Tiao must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 with Quinn. Kim could be in Zone 2 or 3.
- If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1 with Quinn. Kim could be in Zone 1 or 3.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is possible if Tiao is in Zone 1.
B: Mahr works in Zone 1. This is impossible as Mahr must be in Zone 3 with Stuckey.
C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible if Tiao is in Zone 2.

2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
3. S must be earlier than Y.
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Now let's examine each answer choice:
A: If H is fourth, then G and J (the other finance articles) must be 1st and 7th. But this violates the constraint that J must be earlier than G. So this doesn't fully determine a valid order.
B: If H is sixth, there are still multiple possibilities for the other finance articles J and G (they could be 1st/3rd, 1st/4th, 2nd/4th, etc.). So this doesn't fully determine the order.
C: If R is fourth, then:
- G must be third (since G must be earlier than R) 
- J must be second (since J must be earlier than G)
- H must be first (consecutive articles can't have the same topic)
- Y must be fifth (the only spot left for the wildlife article)
- S must be sixth (since S must be earlier than Y)
- Q must be seventh (the only spot left)
So the unique order is: H, J, G, R, Y, S, Q. 
This fully determines the order of all articles.
D: If R is seventh, there are still multiple possibilities for the other nutrition articles S and Q. So this doesn't fully determine the order.

1. If J is third, then the first two articles must be some combination of Q, R, S and Y to avoid consecutive same-topic articles. 
2. S cannot be first or second because it must come before Y.
3. Q also cannot be first, because if J is third, Q can only be third if it comes after S.
4. Therefore, the first two articles must be R and Y in some order.
5. With J third, G must be fourth to satisfy the constraint that J is before G. 
6. Then R must be fifth, since G must be before R.
7. That leaves positions 6 and 7 for H and S. Since S must be before Y, S must be sixth and Y must be seventh.
So if J is third, the full ordering must be:
1. R or Y

2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since P is third, O cannot be fifth, so O must be first.
3. The eighth composition is either L or H. This eliminates L and H from the other positions.
4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R. And there must be at least two compositions between F and R in either order.
5. If F is fifth, then R must be second or eighth. But R can't be eighth because that spot is taken by L or H. So if F is fifth, R must be second, and T must be sixth. But this contradicts S being sixth. So F cannot be fifth.
6. The only remaining option for the fifth composition is T. This means F must be fourth, to satisfy the condition of T being immediately before F.
7. With F fourth and T fifth, R must be seventh to satisfy the condition of having at least two compositions between F and R.

3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.
5. Let's consider the case where Jaramillo is not assigned. From constraint 2, this means Kayne also cannot be assigned. 
6. Since either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned (constraint 1), and Kayne is not assigned in this case, Novetzke must be assigned.
7. If Novetzke is assigned, and Landon is also assigned, then Landon must be assigned to Zambia (constraint 4), and Novetzke must be assigned to either Venezuela or Yemen.
8. This leaves Ong to be assigned to the remaining country out of Venezuela and Yemen.
9. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned, the three assigned ambassadors must be Novetzke, Landon, and Ong, leaving Jaramillo and Kayne as the unassigned pair.
10. None of the other answer choices are possible given the constraints. For example, Kayne and Novetzke cannot both be unassigned due to constraint 1, and Landon and Ong cannot both be unassigned because that would require Jaramillo, Kayne, and Novetzke to be assigned, which is not possible.

2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.

   - Vaughn: no specific limitation

- Nina gives her report on Monday morning
- Helen gives her report on Tuesday morning 
- Irving gives his report on Tuesday afternoon
- George gives his report on Tuesday (morning or afternoon)

This is consistent with the valid scenario constructed for choice A, so Nina giving a report on Monday is possible.
C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. But George must give his report on Tuesday, and exactly two reports are given each day. So there is no valid scenario where Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then there are three slots left for George, Nina and Robert. But they must present on different days, which is impossible with only 3 slots left. So there is no valid scenario where Olivia gives a report on Monday.

- Xu (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza (#1).
- Robertson (#4) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3).
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is allowed.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step given the constraints:
1. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions. 
2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. 
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
5. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
If Julio leads Wednesday morning, then:
- Olivia must lead Thursday or Friday. 
- Kevin must also lead Thursday or Friday morning since Rebecca must lead the same day as Kevin.
- This means Lan must lead Wednesday afternoon, as Lan can't lead the same day as Olivia.
- Nessa will lead the remaining afternoon session on either Thursday or Friday.
Therefore, the only choice that CANNOT be true is A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. 
Lan must lead Wednesday afternoon in this scenario. All the other choices are possible depending on whether Kevin leads Thursday or Friday morning.

1. First position: This is possible. S can be first, followed by Y (satisfying condition 3), then the other articles in a valid order, e.g., S, Y, Q, J, G, H, R.
2. Third position: This is not possible. If S is third, Q cannot be third (violating condition 2).
3. Fourth position: This is possible. We can have J, Y, H, S, G, Q, R, which satisfies all conditions.
4. Fifth position: This is not possible. If S is fifth, it must be followed by Q and R (to satisfy condition 1 about consecutive articles). But this would put R before G, violating condition 4.
5. Sixth position: This is not possible, as it would violate condition 3 (S must be earlier than Y).

2. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Since bay 4 is produce, textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. 
3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means livestock must be in a higher numbered bay than textiles. Since textiles is in either 3 or 5, livestock must be in either bay 5 or 6 (to be higher than 3), or just bay 6 (to be higher than 5).
4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Livestock is in either bay 5 or 6, so grain must be in bay 6 to have a higher number. This also means livestock must be in bay 5.
5. We've now determined bays 4 (produce), 5 (livestock), and 6 (grain). We also know textiles must be in bay 3, as it's next to produce and livestock is higher.
6. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Produce is in bay 4, so fuel must be in bays 1, 2, or 3. But we know textiles is in bay 3, so fuel is in either bay 1 or 2.
7. The only remaining cargo is machinery. Since bays 1 and 2 are the only open bays, and fuel is in one of them, machinery must be in the other.

1. No more than four French works are selected. This means 0-4 French works could be selected.
2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. So 3-4 novels total will be chosen.
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This is key - the number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This restricts certain scenarios but doesn't force any particular selection.
Now, the critical insight is point #3. No matter what specific works are chosen, this constraint must always be satisfied.
There are only 3 Russian novels total. So at most, 3 Russian novels could be selected. 
To always have at least as many French novels as Russian novels, there must be at least 2 French novels selected in every possible valid selection. If only 1 or 0 French novels were chosen, then there could be scenarios with more Russian novels.
Therefore, the one thing that must be selected in all cases is two French novels. The other constraints can be satisfied in multiple ways, but 2+ French novels are needed to ensure there are always at least as many French novels as Russian novels.

- K is on a higher shelf than F.
- O is on a higher shelf than L.
- F and M are on the same shelf.
Choice A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

- However, the placement of the other books is still ambiguous.
- Eliminate A.
Choice B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
- K must be on the top shelf to be higher than F.
- So this would put both K and G on the top shelf.
- O must also be on the top shelf to be higher than L.
- This violates the condition of more books on the bottom than the top.
- Eliminate B.
Choice C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
- F and M are already given to be on the same shelf.
- So this would put L, F and M all on the bottom shelf.
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K and O must be on the top shelf to satisfy their conditions.

   C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

1. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client. So we need to find the most restrictive target.
2. The key constraints are:
   - No client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target. 
   - Image has the shortest voicemail target.
   - Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's.
3. Image must have the 1-day voicemail target, the shortest. So Image's website target can only be 1 day.
4. The other two clients, Solide and Truvest, must have either the 2-day or 3-day voicemail targets.
5. If a client has a 3-day voicemail target, it must also have a 3-day website target, as the website target can't be longer. 
6. There are only two 2+ day voicemail slots available for Solide and Truvest. So only one of them can have a 3-day voicemail target.
7. Therefore, the 3-day website target can only be assigned to the one client with the 3-day voicemail target. It cannot be assigned to more than one client.

","Okay, let's carefully consider each condition and evaluate the answer choices:
1. None of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. None of the clients has a website target of 2 days.
If no website target is 2 days, the possible website targets are 1 day and 3 days.
Image's voicemail target is the shortest (1 day per condition 2). So Image's website target must be 1 day.
That means Solide and Truvest have website targets of 3 days. Solide's voicemail target could be 2 days and Truvest's 3 days, satisfying all conditions.
Now let's look at each choice:

   This means we have two possible orderings: ...O...S... or ...S...O... (where ... represents at least one composition)
Now let's evaluate each answer choice:
A. L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
   This violates condition 2 (there are not at least two compositions between R and F).
B. O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L 
   This satisfies all conditions: O is first, T is immediately before F, there are two compositions (P and S) between F and R, the eighth composition is L, P is before S, and there is one composition (H) between S and R.
C. P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H
   This violates condition 3 (O is not first or fifth).
D. P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H
   This satisfies all conditions: T is immediately before F, there are two compositions (S and O) between F and R, O is fifth, the eighth composition is H, P is before S, and there is one composition (S) between P and O.
E. T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H
   This violates condition 2 (there are not at least two compositions between F and R).
Therefore, the correct answers that satisfy all conditions are B and D.
