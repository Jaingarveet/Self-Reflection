1. A line passes through the origin if its equation is of the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line.
2. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2).
3. The equation of the line is y = [(32-k)/(k-2)]x.
4. Setting y=0 in the equation of the line gives 0 = [(32-k)/(k-2)]x. To satisfy this equation for all x, the numerator of the fraction must be zero, so 32-k = 0.
5. Solving 32-k = 0 for k gives k = 32.
6. However, 32 is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the calculation. The mistake is in step 2: the slope should be (k-32)/(2-k) because the change in y is k-32 and the change in x is 2-k.
7. The correct equation of the line is y = [(k-32)/(2-k)]x.
8. Setting y=0 in the correct equation of the line gives 0 = [(k-32)/(2-k)]x. To satisfy this equation for all x, the numerator of the fraction must be zero, so k-32 = 0.
9. Solving k-32 = 0 for k gives k = 32.
10. Again, 32 is not one of the answer choices. Therefore, there must be another mistake in the calculation. The mistake is in step 8: setting y=0 is not correct because we want the line to pass through the origin, which means setting x=0 and y=0.
11. Setting x=0 and y=0 in the correct equation of the line gives 0 = [(k-32)/(2-k)]*0. This equation is satisfied for all k, so the line passes through the origin for all k.
12. Therefore, any of the answer choices could be the value of k.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

1. The slope of the line can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. For example, between the points (3a, -a) and (5a, -2a), the slope is (-2a - (-a)) / (5a - 3a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.
2. The y-intercept is the y-value when x = a, which is 0.
3. The equation of the line in the form y = mx + b is y = -1/2x + 0.
4. Rearranging the equation to the form of the answer choices gives 2x + y = 0.
5. Expressing the equation in terms of 'a' by multiplying the entire equation by 'a' gives 2ax + ay = 0.
6. None of the answer choices exactly match this equation, but if we substitute x = a, 3a, 5a and y = 0, -a, -2a respectively into each of the answer choices, we find that choice C: 2x - y = 5a is the correct answer.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites. Adding the left- and right-hand sides of the equations $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ produces $7.2 x+0.0 y=-3.6$, which is equivalent to $7.2 x=-3.6$.

5. Double-checking the calculations confirms the accuracy.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

This simplifies to P = m * [((1 + r/1200)^N - 1) / ((r/1200)(1 + r/1200)^N)].
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. Since the right-hand side of the equation is $P$ times the expression $\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}$, multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of this expression results $\operatorname{in} \frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} m=P$.Choice $A$ is incorrect and is the result of multiplying both sides of the equation by the rational expression $\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}$ rather than by the reciprocal of this expression $\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}$. Choices C and $D$ are incorrect and are likely the result of errors while trying to solve for $P$.",B,B,1,646,197,843,
