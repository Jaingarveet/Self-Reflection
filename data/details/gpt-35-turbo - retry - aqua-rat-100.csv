","Thought:
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The space diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
Let x be the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
Then, x^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 = 250.
The diameter of the sphere is equal to x.
Solving for x, we get x = sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10).
Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2x = 10*sqrt(10).

Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) feet and x feet.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)
Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet:

Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house per day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house per day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house per day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
So, the remaining work is 2/3.
Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the remaining work.
The total work done is 4/3 + 3/4 = 13/6.
The remaining work is 1 - 13/6 = 1/6.
Mr.Blue can complete 1/12 of the work per day.

So Brown's one day work is x/6, black's can do x/8 work in

If she uses pairs of letters, she can create 10 pairs using the 10 different types of books. 
The number of ways to choose 2 letters from a set of 26 is 26 choose 2, which is (26*25)/2 = 325.

At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)

The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, so it produces 420 x 12 = 5040 units per year.
The production cost to the company of each component is $110, so the total production cost per year is 5040 x $110 = $554,400.
The yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) should be at least $626,400, so the revenue from sales should be at least $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800.
The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is the selling price that will give the revenue of $1,180,800 when 5040 units are sold.
Let x be the minimum selling price per component.
Then, the revenue from sales is x x 5040 = 5040x.
To guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400, we need to have 5040x - $554,400 >= $626,400.

From the problem, we know that:
D = S x 6 (distance = speed x time for the forward journey)
D = (S + 12) x 4 (distance = speed x time for the return journey)
We can solve for S by equating the two equations above:

","Thought:
The outer surface of the cube is of size 5x5x1 = 25 cm^2.
The inner surface of the hollow cube is of size 3x3x1 = 9 cm^2.
So, the total surface area of the smaller cubes is 25 - 9 = 16 cm^2.
The number of smaller cubes that have unpainted faces is equal to the number of cubes that are not on the surface of the larger cube.
There are 3x3x3 = 27 smaller cubes on each face of the larger cube.
There are 6 faces in total, so there are 6x27 = 162 smaller cubes on the surface of the larger cube.
The total number of smaller cubes is 5x5x5 = 125.
Therefore, the number of smaller cubes that have unpainted faces is 125 - 162 = -37, which is not possible.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

The distance traveled by the ship = x * t
The distance traveled by the plane = 10x * t
The total distance traveled by both is 180 miles.
Therefore, x * t + 10x * t = 180
Simplifying the equation, we get t = 12.
The distance traveled by the ship = x * t = x * 12

Let's start by listing the first five consecutive odd numbers:  1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
We can see that the sum of these numbers is 25, which is a perfect square.
Let's try to generalize this pattern for any five consecutive odd numbers.
Let's assume that the first odd number is n. Then the five consecutive odd numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8.
The sum of these numbers is 5n+20, which can be simplified to 5(n+4).
Since the sum is divisible by 10, we know that n+4 must be divisible by 2.
Therefore, n must be an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
Let's check each answer choice to see which one satisfies this condition:
A: 47 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
B: 91 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.
C: 41 is an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4. Let's check if it works.

","Thought:
Let's first calculate the total distance of the journey. 
Let's call the total distance ""d"".
The train travels at 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, so it covers a distance of 100*10 = 1000 miles.
Let's call the distance covered before it starts raining ""x"".
So, x = d/4 (since it covers a quarter of the distance before it starts raining).
The remaining distance after it starts raining is 3/4 of the total distance, so the distance remaining is 3d/4.
The train travels at 75 miles/hour for the remaining distance.
Let's call the time it takes to cover the remaining distance ""t"".
So, 3d/4 = 75t.
Solving for ""t"", we get t = (3/4)d/75 = d/100.
The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining and the time taken to cover the remaining distance.
The time taken to cover the distance before it starts raining is x/100, since the train is traveling at 100 miles/hour.
So, the total time taken is (d/4)/100 + d/100 = 5d/400 = d/80.
We know that d = 1000 + x, so substituting this value, we get d/80 = (1000 + x)/80 = 12.5 + x/80.
We already know that x = d/4, so substituting this value, we get d/80 = 12.5 + (d/4)/80 = 12.5 + d/320.
Solving for ""d"", we get d = 4000/3.
The total journey duration is the time taken to cover this distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour for the first quarter of the journey, and at a speed of 75 miles/hour for the remaining distance.
The time taken is d/4*100 + 3d/4*75 = 1000/3 + 2250 = 3250/3.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Distance to destination = 100 X 10 = 1000 miles.

The distance towards the east is greater than the distance towards the west, so the final point will be 2 km towards the east from the starting point.
The remaining distances are 3 km towards the south and 3 km towards the north, which cancel each other out.
So, the remaining distance is the distance between the starting point and the final point, which is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides 2 km and 5 km.

Total investment = Rs. 40,000 (A) + Rs. 60,000 (B) + Rs. 120,000 (C) = Rs. 220,000
Ratio of profit sharing = (A's investment * time) : (B's investment * time) : (C's investment * time)

Then, the ratio of profit sharing = (40000*12) : (60000*(12-2-t)) : (120000*(12-t))
150000/375000 = (40000*12) : (60000*(12-2-t)) : (120000*(12-t))
