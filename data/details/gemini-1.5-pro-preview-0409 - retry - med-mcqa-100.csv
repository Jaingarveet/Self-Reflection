*   **Rhinoscleroma:** This is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It typically presents with nasal obstruction, discharge, and crusting.
*   **Wegener's granulomatosis (GPA):** This is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as the kidneys. Nasal symptoms can include obstruction, discharge, crusting, and saddle nose deformity.

*   **Rhinosporidiosis:** This is a chronic fungal infection caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi. It typically presents with nasal polyps and bleeding.
Without the biopsy image, it's impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the clinical presentation, Wegener's granulomatosis (GPA) could be a possibility. 
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease.
