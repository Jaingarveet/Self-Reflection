","Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre

","Thought: 
An unstable lie refers to a situation where the position of the fetus in the uterus changes frequently. This can be due to several reasons. Oligohydramnios (A) refers to a condition where there is less amniotic fluid than normal, which could potentially allow for more movement of the fetus, but it is not the most common cause. Placenta previa (B) is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the mother's cervix, which can cause the baby to change positions frequently, resulting in an unstable lie. A pelvic tumor (C) could potentially cause an unstable lie by physically displacing the fetus, but this is relatively rare. Uterine anomalies (D) could potentially cause an unstable lie by altering the shape or size of the uterus, but again, this is relatively rare.
