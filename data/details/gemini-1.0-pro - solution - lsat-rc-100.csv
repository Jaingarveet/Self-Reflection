This suggests that the physics community was aware of earlier theoretical developments.

This suggests that the physics community did not reevaluate calculations indicating that atoms could be split.

This suggests that the physics community did identify the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
The passage states that ""a common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse."" This suggests that the physics community did not recognize that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.

","## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly assumed that the passage supported the claim that much of the imagery used in corridos can also be identified in ballads from Spain. However, the passage only mentions that corridos have roots in 18th-century Spain, not that they share specific imagery with Spanish ballads.
**Correct Answer:** E
**Reasoning for Correct Answer:** The passage states that the despedida is ""the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity."" This suggests that the author believes that the despedida is an essential element of the corrido form. Therefore, a corrido without a surviving despedida would be incomplete and would not fully represent the corrido tradition.

  B: Although few species of plants have benefited from evolutionary interaction with insects, many species of insects use plants without either harming the plants or increasing the plants' chances of survival.
  C: Throughout the process of evolutionary change, the number of plant species within each family has generally increased while the number of families of plants has decreased.
  D: No particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

","Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the passage. I focused on the fact that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' defenses, but I did not consider the fact that this is not the only way that insects have influenced the development of secondary substances in plants.
The passage states that some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. This suggests that the diversity of secondary substances that develop in a plant population is proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history.

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the author's argument in passage A. I now understand that the author believes that law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This is because rules of law are almost always overinclusive, and enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs.
In light of this understanding, I believe that the author of passage A would be most likely to agree with statement D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills. This is because placing liens on properties would be a more effective way to collect the money owed to the city, without the social costs associated with shutting off people's water.

","Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the author's ideas about identity in pre-contact Native American cultures. I have now reviewed the passage and have a better understanding of the author's argument.
The author argues that in pre-contact Native American cultures, identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. This means that a person's identity was not just about who they were as an individual, but also about how they were connected to their community, their environment, and the universe.
The author also argues that in these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events. This means that people would share their stories and experiences as they were happening, rather than waiting to write them down later in life.
With this understanding, I can now answer the question correctly.
The answer that is most consistent with the author's ideas about identity in pre-contact Native American cultures is B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.
This answer is consistent with the author's argument because it shows how a person's identity was connected to the cosmos. The constellation is a symbol of the universe, and by incorporating it into the pictograph, the person is showing how their identity is connected to the larger world.
The other answers are not consistent with the author's ideas about identity.
Answer A is not consistent with the author's ideas because it focuses on the individual, rather than on the relationship between the individual and the community.
Answer C is not consistent with the author's ideas because it focuses on a ritual, rather than on the expression of life experiences.
Answer D is not consistent with the author's ideas because it focuses on the individual, rather than on the relationship between the individual and the cosmos.
Answer E is not consistent with the author's ideas because it focuses on the individual, rather than on the relationship between the individual and the community.
