","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The rectangular solid is a cuboid with dimensions 3, 4, and 15. 
2) The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the diagonal of the cuboid. This is because the diagonal connects two opposite vertices, which are on the surface of the sphere.
3) We can find the diagonal using the 3D Pythagorean theorem:
   diagonal^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2
4) Simplifying:
   diagonal^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250
5) Taking the square root of both sides:
   diagonal = sqrt(250) = 5 * sqrt(10)
6) Now, let's compare this value with the given choices. We can see that 5 * sqrt(10) is approximately equal to 15.8113.
Action: Answer(""B"")","In an inscribed rectangle in a sphere, we will have a line joining the opposite vertices as the diameter.

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Initially, there are 10 vehicles with an average weight of 12.2 tons.
2. Let the weight of the heavy duty truck be x tons.
3. After adding the truck, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.
4. We can set up an equation based on the new average:
   (12.2 × 10 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8
5. Simplify:
   (122 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8
6. Multiply both sides by 11:
   122 + x = 14.8 × 11
   122 + x = 162.8
7. Subtract 122 from both sides:
   x = 162.8 - 122
   x = 40.8
Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.
Action: Answer(""A"")","The new average is 14.8 tons.

1. Let's say the original square cloth had a side length of x feet.
2. After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions of x feet by (x - 4) feet.
3. This rectangle is cut diagonally to form two triangles. Each triangle has a base of x feet and a height of (x - 4) feet.
4. We're told that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height
5. Substituting the values:
   70 = (1/2) * x * (x - 4)
   140 = x^2 - 4x
   x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
6. This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
   x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
   Here, a = 1, b = -4, c = -140
7. Solving:
   x = [4 ± √(16 + 560)] / 2
   x = [4 ± √576] / 2
   x = [4 ± 24] / 2
   x = 14 or -10

1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code each type of book. But the question suggests we can use pairs of letters too.
2) If Amy uses only pairs of letters, she would need 5 letters. This is because with 5 letters, there are 10 unique pairs (5C2 = 10).
3) However, the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed. So we should consider using a mix of single letters and pairs.
4) Let's say Amy uses 4 letters: A, B, C, and D. With these, she can create 6 unique pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Along with the 4 single letters, this gives her 10 unique codes, which is exactly what she needs.
5) If she used only 3 letters, she could make only 3 single letter codes and 3 pair codes (3C2 = 3), for a total of 6 codes. This is not enough.
Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.

1. The company produces 420 units per month.
2. The production cost per unit is $110.
3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
To find the minimum selling price, we need to:
1. Calculate the yearly production
2. Calculate the yearly production cost
3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost
4. Divide the result by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit
Calculations:
1. Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
2. Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400
3. Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
   = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
4. Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.29 per unit

3) Now, we need to find the percentage increase needed to go from 70 units back to the original 100 units.
4) The increase needed is 100 - 70 = 30 units.
5) To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the current price and multiply by 100:

1. Let the distance be x km and the speed of the jeep in the forward journey be y km/hr.
2. In the forward journey, Distance = Speed × Time

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let's assume Jacob made x toys. Then, Alex made (35 - x) toys.
2. Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up an equation:
   7(35 - x) ≈ 9x
3. Simplify the left side of the equation:
   245 - 7x ≈ 9x
4. Add 7x to both sides:
   245 ≈ 16x
5. Divide both sides by 16:
   x ≈ 15.3125
6. Since x represents the number of toys Jacob made, it must be a whole number. The closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.
Therefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. 
   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 30 - 10√3 = 10(3 - √3)
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 10(3 - √3) more minutes.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)

3. Now, the wire is rebent to form a square. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 88 cm.
4. To find the side length of the square, we divide the perimeter by 4 (as a square has 4 equal sides):

   B: Stock B increases in value
2) We are given:
   P(A) = 0.56
   P(B) = 0.74
3) We are asked to find the maximum value of P(neither A nor B), which is equivalent to P(not A and not B).
4) By the multiplication rule for independent events:
   P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B)
5) We can find P(not A) and P(not B):
   P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
   P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:
   
   Area of square = side × side = 20 × 20 = 400 cm²
2) Two semicircles are cut out from this square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So the radius of each semicircle is 10 cm.

1. Let the cost price of the book be Rs. x.
2. The book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. So, the selling price is 110% of the cost price.
   27.50 = 110% of x
   27.50 = 1.1x
   x = 27.50 / 1.1
   x = 25
So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.
Now, if the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, then:
Selling price = Rs. 25.75
Cost price = Rs. 25
Profit/Loss % = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100

1) The cube has a side length of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. This means the hollow part has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2 * 1cm).
2) The total number of 1cm cubes in a 5cm cube is 5^3 = 125.
3) The number of 1cm cubes in the hollow part is 3^3 = 27.
4) So, the number of 1cm cubes that make up the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98.
5) Each 1cm cube has 6 faces. So, the total number of faces of the 1cm cubes is 98 * 6 = 588.
6) The outer surface of the big cube consists of 5 * 5 * 6 = 150 faces of the 1cm cubes.
7) Therefore, the number of faces of the 1cm cubes that remain unpainted is 588 - 150 = 438.

So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube

Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98

3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, the total width of all pickets and spaces is 13x/2 inches.
5) But the question asks for the length of the fence in feet.
6) To convert inches to feet, we need to divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
7) So, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2) / 12 = 13x/24 feet.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. The monthly salary S is composed of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of monthly sales. Let's call the monthly sales x.
2. We can write an equation:
   S = 500 + 0.05x
3. We want to find x when S = 1500. So, let's substitute 1500 for S:
   1500 = 500 + 0.05x
4. Subtract 500 from both sides:
   1000 = 0.05x
5. Divide both sides by 0.05:
   1000/0.05 = x
   20000 = x
Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Let S be the total monthly salary and x be the monthly sales, hence
S = 500 + 5% * x

   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)
3. According to the second condition:
   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

1. Find the time for one rotation of Ball A:
   * Ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes
   * Time for 1 rotation of A = 26 ÷ 2 = 13 minutes
2. Find the time for one rotation of Ball B:
   * Ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes
   * Time for 1 rotation of B = 35 ÷ 5 = 7 minutes
3. To find when they meet at the starting point, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation times:

4. Convert 91 minutes to hours and minutes:
   * 91 ÷ 60 = 1 remainder 31
   * This means 1 hour and 31 minutes
Therefore, Ball A and Ball B will meet at the starting point after 1 hour and 31 minutes.
Action: Answer(""A"")","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

1) If B bisects minor arc AC, then minor arc AB is half of minor arc AC.
   Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°
2) In a circle, the sum of opposite arcs is 360°. So, major arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°.
3) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc AC.
   Major arc AB = 200° / 2 = 100°
4) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.
5) To find minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from major arc AB.
   Minor arc AD = Major arc AB - Minor arc BD
                = 100° - 150°
                = -50°
6) However, the measure of an arc cannot be negative. This means that D is actually on the major arc AB, not the minor arc AB.
7) So, to find the actual measure of minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from the full circle:
   Minor arc AD = 360° - 150°

2. The ages are in Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is 0.25 years.
3. The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
4. The sum of the ages of all members is 250.
We know the formula for the sum of an A.P. is:
Sum = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.
Substituting the values:
250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]
250 = n/2 * [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]
250 = n/2 * [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = n * [13.75 + 0.25n]
500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2

0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0
Using the quadratic formula:
n = [-13.75 ± √(13.75^2 - 4*0.25*-500)] / (2*0.25)
  = [-13.75 ± √(189.0625 + 500)] / 0.5

2) From the given information:
   6p = 2r (six pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two rolls)
   3r = 5b (three rolls have the same amount of falafel as five baguettes)
3) We want to find how many pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. Let's call this number x.
   So, xp = 2b
4) From the first equation, we can express r in terms of p:
   6p = 2r
   r = 3p
5) Substituting this into the second equation:
   3(3p) = 5b
   9p = 5b
6) Now, we have xp = 2b and 9p = 5b. We can solve for x:
   xp = 2b
   x(9p) = x(5b) (multiplying both sides by x)
   9xp = 10b (using the fact that xp = 2b)

5) There are 20 fiction books. So at most, 20 of the hardcover books could also be fiction.
6) However, we need to check if this is possible given the total number of hardcover books. There are 30 hardcover books total, which is more than 20. So it is possible for all 20 fiction books to also be hardcover.

   x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
     = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

3. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be z rupees. Then, each white sharpener costs (z + 1) rupees.
4. The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we can write the equation:

   x(z + 1) + yz = 100
6. Substituting y = 18 - x in the second equation:

1. The cow is tethered with a 14 feet long rope. This means the cow can graze in a circular area with a radius of 14 feet.
2. The area of a circle is given by the formula: A = πr², where r is the radius.
   
   Area = π * 14² = 616 sq.ft. (rounded to the nearest whole number)
3. The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day. To find the time taken to graze the whole field, we need to divide the total area by the area grazed per day.
   Time = Total Area / Area grazed per day

1) First, let's consider the number of possibilities for the letters. If the letters need to be distinct, then for the first letter we have 26 choices (assuming we are using the English alphabet), and for the second letter we have 25 choices (because we can't use the same letter again).

A : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x
We know C's share is Rs. 150,000 out of the total profit of Rs. 375,000. So:
120,000x / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) = 150,000 / 375,000
Solving this equation:
120,000x = 150,000 × (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) / 375,000
120,000x = 180,000 + 225,000 + 90,000x
30,000x = 405,000
x = 13.5
So, C joined 13.5 months after A started the business, or 11.5 months after B joined.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Assume that C was there in the business for x months
A:B:C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x
= 40*12 : 60*10 : 120x = 40 : 5*10 : 10x
=8 : 10 : 2x
= 4 : 5 : x
C's share = 375000*x/(9+x) = 150000
=> 375x/(9+x) = 150
=> 15x = 6(9+x)
=> 5x = 18 + 2x
=> 3x = 18
=> x = 18/3 = 6
It means C was there in the business for 6 months. Given that B joined the business
after 2 months. Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined

","To calculate the reduction percent, we can use the following formula:
Reduction percent = (Original value - Reduced value) / Original value * 100
Given:
- Original value = 120
- Reduced value = 96
Step 1: Calculate the difference between the original and reduced values.
120 - 96 = 24
Step 2: Divide the difference by the original value.
24 / 120 = 0.2
Step 3: Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.
0.2 * 100 = 20
Therefore, the reduction percent is 20%.
Action: Answer(""C"")","reduction = 120 – 96 = 24
∴ Reduction percent = (24/120)×100% =20%

  E: None of these
","To calculate the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we need to find the simple interest and add it to the principal amount.
Given:
- Principal (P) = Rs. 500
- Rate of interest (r) = 6% per annum
- Time (t) = 4 years
The formula for simple interest is:
Simple Interest (SI) = (P × r × t) / 100
Calculation:
SI = (500 × 6 × 4) / 100
SI = 12,000 / 100
SI = 120
The total amount to be paid = Principal + Simple Interest
Total amount = 500 + 120 = Rs. 620
Action: Answer(""C"")","We need to calculate the total amount to be paid by him after 4 years, so it will be Principal + simple interest.

","Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + breadth)
   = 2(16 + 3.75)
   = 2(19.75)
   = 39.5 m
The closest option to 39.5 m is 40 m.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 m
