Condition (2) states that F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
Condition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
Condition (4) states that F must be allocated in the production department.

From condition (4), we know that F must be allocated in the production department.
Since F is in the production department, G cannot be in the production department due to condition (2).
Therefore, G must be in the sales department.

Since F is in the production department, there are two more spots left in the production department.
From condition (1), H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
If H and Y are allocated in the production department, then the production department would be full, and there would be no spot left for W if X is allocated in the sales department (condition 3).
Therefore, H and Y cannot be allocated in the production department.
They must be allocated in the public relations department.

If X is allocated in the sales department, then W must be allocated in the production department (condition 3).
Since F is already in the production department, the remaining spot in the production department must be filled by I.
Therefore, the production department would consist of F, W, and I.

If X is not allocated in the sales department, then W can be allocated in any department.
However, since H and Y are already in the public relations department, W cannot be allocated there.
If W is allocated in the production department, then the remaining spot in the production department must be filled by I.
Therefore, the production department would consist of F, W, and I.

In either case, the production department consists of F, W, and I.
Since H and Y are in the public relations department, the remaining spot in the public relations department must be filled by X.
Therefore, the public relations department consists of H, Y, and X.

Since G is in the sales department, the remaining spots in the sales department must be filled by I and W (if W is not in the production department).
However, W is already in the production department.
Therefore, the sales department consists of G, I, and another employee who cannot be F, G, H, Y, or W.
The only remaining employee is I.

Therefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:
Public Relations Department: H, Y, X
Production Department: F, W, I

However, this choice is still retry because H and Y are not in the same department.
Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let's go back to the point where I allocated W to the production department.
If W is allocated to the production department, then X cannot be allocated to the sales department because there would be no spot left for W in the production department (condition 3).
Therefore, X must be allocated to the public relations department.

If X is allocated to the public relations department, then the remaining spot in the public relations department must be filled by W.
Therefore, the public relations department consists of H, Y, and W.

Since F is in the production department, the remaining spots in the production department must be filled by G and I.
However, G cannot be in the production department because of condition (2).
Therefore, the production department consists of F, H, and Y (since H and Y must be in the same department).

Since G is not in the production department, G must be in the sales department.
The remaining spots in the sales department must be filled by I and W (if W is not in the public relations department).
However, W is already in the public relations department.
Therefore, the sales department consists of G, I, and another employee who cannot be F, G, H, Y, or W.

From the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.

Let's try to arrange the departments based on this information.

Since the finance department is next to the planning department, they must be on consecutive floors. The administration department is above the planning department, so it cannot be on the first floor. The human resources department is above the administration department, so it cannot be on the first or second floor.

Using this information, we can eliminate options C and D because they both have the sales department on the first floor, which would mean it is adjacent to the human resources department, violating the first condition.

Now let's consider options A and B. In option A, the sales department is on the top floor, which means it is not adjacent to the human resources department, satisfying the first condition. The finance department is next to the planning department, satisfying the second condition. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department, satisfying the third condition.

In option B, the sales department is on the fifth floor, which means it is adjacent to the human resources department, violating the first condition.

The original argument states that all landscape rooms can see the landscape, and since Li Wenbing's family can't see the landscape, they are not a landscape room. This is an example of a logical deduction based on a premise.

To find the most similar argument, we need to look for an option that follows the same logical structure: a general statement, followed by a specific case that contradicts the general statement, leading to a conclusion.

Option A is not similar because it presents a specific case that confirms the general statement, rather than contradicting it.

Option C is not similar because it presents a specific case that confirms the general statement, rather than contradicting it.

Option D is not similar because it presents a specific case that does not necessarily contradict the general statement.

Option B is similar because it presents a general statement (vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap), followed by a specific case that contradicts the general statement (this basket of vegetables is not cheap), leading to a conclusion (therefore, this basket of vegetables is not from Dongdun Market).

The statement presents a dilemma faced by a developing country, where maintaining economic development requires strengthening the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, while maintaining social stability requires establishing and improving social security systems such as pensions, medical care, and unemployment. However, the cost of establishing and improving social security systems falls on enterprises, which must pay a certain percentage of social insurance premiums for employees every year, thereby reducing their competitiveness.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the country faces a trade-off between maintaining economic development and social stability. Specifically, if the country wants to maintain social stability by improving social security systems, it may reduce the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, which could negatively impact economic development.
