","Thought:
From the given conditions, we can deduce that:

* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review only one play, and it cannot be Tamerlane (since Megregian reviews all three plays).
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they each review at least one play.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Megregian reviews all three plays, this means that either Kramer or O'Neill must also review all three plays.

From these deductions, we can see that:

* Jiang reviews only one play, so A must be true.
* Megregian reviews all three plays, so B must be true.
* O'Neill reviews at least one play, but we don't know if he reviews more than one, so we can't determine if C is true.

Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7, they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, they must be featured on days 1, 3, and 5.
Therefore, the only pair of days that cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy is day 3 and day 5, since they feature different breeds of puppies.

Since L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, L must be on the top shelf.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf as well.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the top shelf because it already has two books (L and O). Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.

Wait, I cannot choose ""None of the above"". In this case, I will choose the answer that is least likely to be false.

Explanation:
Since Theresa cannot test J on the first day, the only bicycles left for her to test are H and G. Since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, she must test H on the first day. Therefore, G must be tested by either Reynaldo or Seamus on the first day. If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the first day, and Yuki must test G on the second day. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, it is possible that Reynaldo tests G on the second day.",,N,B,0,509,235,744,

","Thought:
If S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first or fifth, so O must be performed either second or third.
If O is performed second, then P cannot be performed first, so P must be performed third. But this would mean that no composition is performed after O and before S, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, O must be performed third.
If O is performed third, then P must be performed either first or second.
If P is performed first, then R cannot be performed second, so R must be performed third. But this would mean that T cannot be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, P must be performed second.
If P is performed second, then R cannot be performed first, so R must be performed third. But this would mean that T cannot be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, which violates the given condition.
Therefore, R cannot be performed third.
If R is not performed third, then T must be performed third.
If T is performed third, then F must be performed either first or second.
If F is performed first, then H cannot be performed second, so H must be performed eighth. But this would mean that L must be performed second, which violates the given condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
Therefore, F must be performed second.
If F is performed second, then H cannot be performed first, so H must be performed eighth.

A: H is fourth.
If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S (in any order), since S can't be earlier than Q unless Q is third, and S must be earlier than Y. But this would mean that two consecutive articles cover the same topic (nutrition), which violates condition 1. So, A is not correct.

If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.

4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and I is already on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the bottom shelf.

Now we have:
Top shelf: K, O
Middle shelf: I
Bottom shelf: F, M

We still need to place G and H, and we know that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.

Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the same kind of cookie as the ones made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, as there must be at least one batch made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they cannot both be made on Tuesday.

From the conditions given, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Since there are only seven sales representatives and there are more of them working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least three representatives.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 1.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 1 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.

Since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day and Truvest's website target must be 3 days.
Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.

The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.
Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be in space 1.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 6 and 7.

We also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so fuel cannot be in bay 3.
Finally, we know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1.
Based on this information, we can eliminate choices A, B, and D, since they all have textiles in bay 3. We can also eliminate choice C, since it has livestock in bay 2, which contradicts the information that livestock has a higher number than textiles.

","Thought:
Since Himalayans are not featured on day 1 or day 2, and they must be featured on exactly three days, they must be featured on days 3, 5, and 6.
Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, they cannot be featured on days 3, 5, or 6.
Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 2.
Since Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7, and they cannot be featured on day 2, they must be featured on day 4.
Since Manx cannot be featured on day 3, and they cannot be featured on day 2 (since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days), they must be featured on day 1 or day 7.

Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.

Therefore, the first two houses must be chosen from L, M, N, O, and P.
Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.
If J is the sixth house, then K, L, M, N, and O must be shown before it, but this is not possible since L must be shown after K and before M.
