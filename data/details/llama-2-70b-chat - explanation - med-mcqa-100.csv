Explanation:
Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to enzymatic digestion. Enzymes, such as proteases and lipases, break down the cellular components, leading to the destruction of the cell. This process is not related to calcium efflux, fat deposition, or water imbibition. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Enzymatic digestion.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the mechanism of necrosis. I thought that necrosis was caused by the efflux of calcium ions from the cell, but it is actually caused by enzymatic digestion. This mistake highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of cellular processes. By taking the time to reflect on my mistake, I was able to correct my understanding and provide the correct answer.","Necrosis: Type of cell death associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents culminating in the dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The enzymes responsible for digestion of cells may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cell themselves and from lysosomes of leucocytes recruited as pa of inflammation. The leaked cellular contents often elicit an inflammatory response.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the pathological features of membranous nephropathy with those of another kidney disease.
The crescent-shaped deposits are actually a hallmark of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), not membranous nephropathy.

Reflection:
This question highlights the importance of careful observation and attention to detail in pathology.
It's essential to distinguish between different kidney diseases based on their unique pathological features.
In this case, I mistakenly attributed the crescent-shaped deposits to the wrong disease, demonstrating the need for meticulousness in diagnosis.
To avoid similar errors, I will make sure to thoroughly review the characteristics of each disease and double-check my answers.
Additionally, I will seek out opportunities to practice identifying these pathological features, ensuring that I become more proficient in recognizing them.
By doing so, I can improve my diagnostic accuracy and better serve patients.","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is also referred to as crescentic glomerulonephritis.

","Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

The correct answer is B: High concentration. Bicarbonate buffers have a high concentration in blood, which makes them effective at maintaining pH homeostasis. This is because a high concentration of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) can effectively neutralize hydrogen ions (H+) and maintain the body's pH within a narrow range.

In contrast, choice A (pKa is equal to pH) is incorrect because pKa is a measure of the strength of an acid, and it is not directly related to the effectiveness of a buffer. Choice C (weak acid and weak base combination) is also incorrect because, while bicarbonate is a weak base, it is not a weak acid. Choice D (easy to measure) is not a relevant factor in determining the effectiveness of a buffer.","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U.

It can occur independently or as part of other genetic syndromes, but it is not a feature of Kaagener's syndrome.

Kaagener's syndrome, also known as ciliary dyskinesia, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the structure and function of cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures found in various parts of the body, including the respiratory and digestive systems.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the most common type of seizure in newborns with the most common type of seizure in older children and adults, which is tonic-clonic seizures. However, newborns have a different pattern of seizure activity, and the most common type of seizure in this age group is actually subtle seizures. Subtle seizures are characterized by a brief, subtle change in the newborn's behavior or movement, such as a pause in breathing, a brief tremor, or a change in muscle tone. They can be easily missed, and it is important for healthcare providers to be vigilant in monitoring newborns for these types of seizures.","Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Neonatal seizures: Usual onset at 12-48 hours. Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the term ""blood discharge"" and thought it referred to a malignancy. I was not familiar with the term ""duct papilloma"" and its association with nipple discharge. However, after reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that duct papilloma is indeed the most common cause of blood discharge from the nipple. It is a benign tumor that arises from the lactiferous ducts and can cause nipple discharge, which may be clear, yellowish, or blood-stained. Duct carcinoma, chronic cystic mastitis, and cystosarcoma phyllodes can also cause nipple discharge, but they are less common causes compared to duct papilloma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Duct papilloma.","Duct papilloma is the Commonest cause of blood discharge from the nipple Duct papilloma are epithelium lined true polyps of breast lactiferous ducts it is usually single,from a single lactiferous duct it blocks the duct causing ductal dialatation ref ;(page no;528) 5th edition of SRB&;S Manual of SURGERY",B,B,1,465,206,671,

The internal carotid artery (ICA) has three main branches: anterior communicating, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral. These branches supply blood to different parts of the brain. The posterior communicating artery is not a branch of the ICA but rather a separate artery that arises from the basilar artery. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mechanism of action of brimonidine with that of timolol, pilocarpine, and brinzolamide.
I knew that brimonidine increases the outflow of aqueous humor, but I mistakenly thought it did so by reducing the production of aqueous humor, like the other three medications.
In reality, brimonidine works by increasing the permeability of the trabecular meshwork, allowing more aqueous humor to flow out of the eye.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Pilocarpine, which also increases the outflow of aqueous humor by increasing the permeability of the trabecular meshwork.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between keratoderma blenorrhagica and psoriasis. I knew that keratoderma blenorrhagica is a condition that affects people with psoriasis, but I mistakenly thought it was a symptom of psoriatic arthritis, rather than reactive arthritis.

However, after reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that keratoderma blenorrhagica is actually associated with reactive arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that develops in response to an infection. People with psoriasis are at increased risk of developing reactive arthritis, and keratoderma blenorrhagica is a common symptom of this condition.

Therefore, the correct answer for the question ""Keratoderma blenorrhagica is seen in:"" is option C, Reactive arthritis.

","Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios

Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I overlooked the possibility of placenta previa, which can also cause an unstable lie. I focused too much on the patient's history of previous normal deliveries, which led me to dismiss option B (placenta previa). However, placenta previa can occur in any pregnancy, regardless of the patient's history. Therefore, it is important to consider all options carefully and not make assumptions based on the patient's history.

On reflection, I realized that option B (placenta previa) is a possible cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida patient, and it should have been my first choice. I should have considered the patient's symptoms and the possibility of placenta previa, rather than relying solely on her history of previous normal deliveries.

In conclusion, I have learned to be more thorough in my assessment and consider all options carefully, rather than making assumptions based on the patient's history. This will help me provide better care for my patients and avoid similar mistakes in the future.","Placenta pre can be associated with several other conditions, including malpresentation, unstable lie, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and intrauterine growth restriction.

The ""Liver shrinkage diet"" is advised before bariatric surgery to reduce the risk of complications during the procedure. Bariatric surgery is a type of surgery that helps people lose weight by reducing the size of their stomach.

Explanation:
I have reflected on my previous answer and realized that I confused Selegiline with another anti-Parkinson drug that acts on cholinergic activity, namely Biperiden. Selegiline, also known as Deprenyl, is actually a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that increases the levels of dopamine in the brain, which is depleted in Parkinson's disease. It is used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and has been shown to improve motor function, balance, and coordination. It does not act by decreasing brain cholinergic activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Selegiline.",An antiparkinson medication is a type of drug which is intended to treat and relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Most of these agents act by either increasing dopamine activity or reducing acetylcholine activity in the central nervous system. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.,C,D,0,451,173,624,
