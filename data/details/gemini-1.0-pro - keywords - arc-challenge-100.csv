","Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the concept of mixtures. I thought that a mixture was simply a combination of two or more substances, but I did not realize that the components of a mixture retain their original properties. I also did not understand that mixtures can be separated into their individual components.
I have since learned that a mixture is a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically combined. The components of a mixture retain their original properties and can be separated by physical means. A compound, on the other hand, is a substance that is formed by the chemical combination of two or more elements. The components of a compound cannot be separated by physical means.
I will use this knowledge to answer the question correctly this time.

The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?

","Thought: 
The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. However, the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years. This suggests that there is a factor that is more important for survival than strength and size in this environment.
The introduction of a new predator will likely change the selection pressures on the sheep population. The sheep with dark wool, despite their size and strength, may be more visible to the predator and therefore more likely to be hunted. This would lead to a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool.
