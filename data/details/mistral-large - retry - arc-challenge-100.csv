Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely affect the sheep population based on their physical characteristics, such as wool color, size, and strength. Since the dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, they may be more noticeable to predators, making them more vulnerable to predation. On the other hand, the light wool sheep may be less conspicuous and have a better chance of surviving predation.

Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
","Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
","Thought:
Physical changes involve changes in physical properties such as shape, size, and state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance.
Chemical changes involve changes in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.
The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food.
The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides.
The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones.
The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.

","Thought:
The mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, as electrons have negligible mass.
In this case, the atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons.
The mass of the atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.
