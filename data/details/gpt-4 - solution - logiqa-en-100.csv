Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G must be one of the first three speakers. 
Also, F must speak in the first or third place. 
Since J is the fourth speaker, the third speaker cannot be J, so the third speaker must be F.

Given the conditions:
1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3) The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
4) The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.
From these conditions, we can infer that the human resources department must be on one of the top two floors, as it is above the administrative department, which is above the planning department. The sales department cannot be adjacent to the human resources department, so it cannot be on the top two floors. Therefore, the sales department can be one level above the administrative department, which makes option B possible.

The expert's opinion is that the northern salamanders in Xinjiang are declining because they are being trampled by cattle and sheep. The option that raises the most doubts about this opinion would be the one that introduces a new potential cause for the decline that the expert did not consider. Option B introduces the idea that changes in the water environment could be causing the decline, which raises more doubts about the expert's opinion than the other options.

The inconsistency here is that despite strict investigation of drunk driving, the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities that do and do not strictly investigate drunk driving. The statement that can reconcile this inconsistency is that even with strict investigation, drunk driving has not been eliminated in the cities that implement it, leading to similar accident rates.

The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. This is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.

The assumption that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's (Choice C) contradicts the given information that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, and therefore does not make the inference hold.

The contradiction is that while a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, a majority also would not hire them as such. The best explanation would be a reason that supports the idea of college students as nannies but also provides a reason why they would not be hired. 
Option C provides this explanation: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services. This means that while they favor the idea for the benefit of the students, they do not necessarily believe the students would provide better services, hence they would not hire them.

1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.

From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- The finance department and planning department must be adjacent, but the finance department could be either above or below the planning department.
- The administrative department must be above the planning department but below the human resources department.
- The human resources department cannot be adjacent to the sales department.
