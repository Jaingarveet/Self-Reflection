Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","Let's carefully analyze the data in the table to determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder.
Looking at the ""Colonies with colony collapse disorder (%)"" column:
IAPV: 83%
KBV: 100% 
Nosema apis: 100%
Nosema ceranae: 77%
Both KBV and Nosema apis have the highest infection rate at 100% for colonies with colony collapse disorder.
However, the question asks for a single pathogen. Since either KBV or Nosema apis could be considered correct based on the data, I'll choose KBV as it's listed first in the table.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",B,D,0,1934,161,2095,

","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","Okay, let's carefully analyze the data in the table to determine the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens:
1. The table shows data for four individual pathogens: IAPV virus, KBV virus, Nosema apis fungus, and Nosema ceranae fungus.
2. For colonies with colony collapse disorder:
   - 83% were infected by IAPV virus
   - 100% were infected by KBV virus 
   - 100% were infected by Nosema apis fungus
   - 77% were infected by Nosema ceranae fungus
3. The question asks about the percentage infected by all four pathogens together. This means a colony needs to be infected by each of the four to count towards the total.
4. The limiting factor is the lowest individual percentage, which is 77% for Nosema ceranae. Even if 100% were infected by the other three pathogens, the maximum that could be infected by all four is 77%.
5. Therefore, the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens must be 77%.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",B,B,1,1864,271,2135,

Choices:
  A: They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.

  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The main idea of Passage 1 is that the current Constitutional structure, allowing for both free and slave states, is fundamentally sound and does not need to be altered. The author is directly refuting Lincoln's claim that a nation divided into free and slave states ""cannot stand.""
2. The author makes several explicit statements supporting this idea:
   - The Constitution has allowed the nation to grow and prosper, even with the division into free and slave states. 
   - The Union can continue to exist ""forever"" under the current structure if each state is allowed to manage its own affairs.
   - The author directly states that we can ""go on and extend indefinitely"" under the principle of ""State rights and State sovereignty.""
3. The supporting details about territorial expansion and economic growth are used to reinforce the main point that the current system is working well. They are not the central focus.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
   A. Contradicts the main idea that the current structure is working.
   B. Mentioned but not the main focus.
   C. Matches the author's central argument.
   D. Not supported by the passage.
5. Choice C best encapsulates the author's main point that the Constitution's current provisions for slavery are a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
Therefore, the best answer is C.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1770,319,2089,

","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","You're right, upon rereading the passage and reflecting on the key details, it's clear that Akira's primary fear is that Chie will consider his unorthodox proposal inappropriate given the social norms and traditions of the time.
The passage emphasizes how Akira ""came directly, breaking all tradition"" and ponders if Chie would have been ""more receptive"" if he had followed the proper protocols. Akira himself acknowledges the ""unseemliness of this proposal"" showing he recognizes it is improper.
While Chie's view of Akira as childlike is mentioned, it's more of a minor detail compared to the central focus on the inappropriate nature of his surprise visit and proposal. The other choices about Chie underestimating his sincerity or seeing the visit as an imposition are also not as strongly supported by the text.
Therefore, the best answer is that Akira most fears Chie will consider his proposal inappropriate, since this aligns closest with the main themes and concerns expressed in the passage.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",A,A,1,2173,238,2411,

","Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","You're right, upon re-reading the passage carefully, the narrator's reserved nature around unfamiliar people stands out more than her attentiveness to her surroundings. A few key details show this:
1. She calls Big Uncle's name ""in a shy voice"" when he doesn't recognize her at first. 
2. Rather than actively participating, she tries to ""notice everything"" so she can later tell GaoLing, suggesting she is more comfortable observing than interacting.
3. She listens quietly to her father and uncles without joining the conversation. 
4. Most of the passage focuses on her internal thoughts and reflections rather than external interactions.
While the narrator does notice many details about her father's shop, this seems secondary to her overall reserved demeanor in an unfamiliar setting with people she doesn't know well, like Big Uncle initially. Her shyness and tendency to observe rather than participate are the most prominent character traits portrayed.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",A,A,1,1775,214,1989,

","Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.
","Okay, let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. The first sentence introduces Akira's untraditional approach: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition."" This sets up the main focus of the paragraph.
2. The next sentences pose questions about Chie's reaction and whether it would have been different if Akira had followed tradition: ""Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?"" This shows the paragraph is analyzing Chie's reaction.
3. The rest of the paragraph provides more details about Akira's arrival, but the focus remains on Chie and her response to his breaking of tradition.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
   A. The paragraph does mention cultural traditions but does not describe the culture in detail.
   B. While it notes Akira broke tradition, the main focus is not on criticizing this.
   C. Akira makes a request but this is not the main focus of the paragraph.
   D. The questions and details all center around analyzing Chie's reaction to Akira's untraditional approach.
5. Therefore, the best answer is D - the main purpose of the first paragraph is to analyze Chie's reaction to Akira breaking tradition by coming to her directly.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1927,312,2239,
