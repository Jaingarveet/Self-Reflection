  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This is a fixed condition.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This is also a fixed condition.
3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday cannot be empty.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday. 
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
Now let's look at each choice:
A. Franco being the only witness on Monday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
B. Franco testifying the same day as Iturbe (Wednesday) is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
C. Garcia and Hong both testifying Tuesday is possible. It would satisfy the ""exactly two on Tuesday"" condition.
D. Garcia being the only witness Monday, with Hong being one of two on Wednesday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.
E. If Jackson testifies Tuesday, and two testify Monday, that would mean 3 testify Tuesday (Jackson + the required two). This violates the ""exactly two on Tuesday"" condition.

","You're right, I made an incorrect assumption in my previous attempt. Let me think through this again step-by-step:
The original constraint states the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be a minimum of two spaces between the restaurants.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) If a restaurant must be in space 3, 4, or 5, this would put the restaurants next to each other or only separated by one space. This is not equivalent to the original constraint.
B) The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, not a restaurant. This choice contradicts a given constraint.
C) If the toy store or veterinarian is between the restaurants, this ensures at least two spaces separate the restaurants. This matches the original constraint.
D) If no more than two businesses separate the pharmacy and nearest restaurant, the restaurants could still be next to each other. Not equivalent.
E) The optometrist's location relative to the shoe store is not relevant to the spacing of the restaurants.
Therefore, choice C is the only one that has the same effect as the original spacing constraint on the restaurants.

4. Another rule states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. 
5. Since Young is in either space #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the other of these two spaces to satisfy this rule.
6. If Young is in space #2, then Togowa must be in space #1. This is the only arrangement that satisfies both rules involving Young and Togowa, given that Robertson is in space #3.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the reflection:
1. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.
2. Olivia cannot lead a session on the same day as Lan. So if Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, Olivia must lead a session on the other day (Friday or Thursday, respectively). 
3. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's. If Olivia leads a Thursday session, Julio must lead a Wednesday session. If Olivia leads a Friday session, Julio could lead either a Wednesday or Thursday session.
4. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. This could be any of the three days.
5. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but this could be on any of the three days.
The key insight from the reflection is that if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, it does not necessarily force Julio to lead a Wednesday session. Julio could still lead a Thursday session in some scenarios.
However, if Lan leads a Friday session, then Olivia must lead a Thursday session, which would force Julio to lead a Wednesday session.
Therefore, the only lab assistant that we can say with certainty must lead a Thursday session if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session is Olivia.

If Jackson testifies alone on Monday, that leaves Franco, Garcia, Hong and Iturbe to be scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday.
We know Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. That leaves Franco, Garcia and Hong for the two Tuesday slots.
The conditions state that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. So if two of Franco, Garcia and Hong are scheduled on Tuesday, it must be Hong plus either Franco or Garcia.

3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday must be given by Irving or Nina. 
4. If Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
5. Since Helen is giving a morning report, if Nina reports on Monday afternoon, then Irving must report on Tuesday afternoon. But this conflicts with the fact that George must report on Tuesday afternoon.
6. Therefore, Nina cannot report on Monday. She must report on either Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon.
7. If Nina reports on Tuesday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must report on Wednesday. But Helen is already giving a morning report, so Irving would have to give the Wednesday afternoon report. This satisfies all conditions.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
2. If both botanists G and H are selected, that means more than one botanist is on the panel. 
3. The rules state that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
4. Another rule is that if chemist M is selected, then both zoologists P and R must be selected. 
5. However, selecting both P and R would violate the rule in #3 above, since G and H are already on the panel (more than one botanist).
6. Therefore, if G and H are both selected, chemist M cannot be selected, as that would force the selection of too many zoologists.
7. So the panel must include either chemist F or chemist K to satisfy the requirement of having at least one of each type of scientist.
8. The correct answer is that if both G and H are selected, the panel must include either F or else K.

Given:
- Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday
- Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday
- George can only report on Tuesday
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports
- If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday)
Reasoning:
1. Since Kyle reports Tuesday afternoon, George must report Tuesday morning (only day he can).
2. Helen reports Wednesday afternoon, so Irving must report Wednesday morning (due to Nina's condition). 
3. This leaves Monday's two slots open. Nina cannot report Monday, as that would require both Helen and Irving to report on Tuesday which is not possible.
4. Olivia and Robert can only report in the morning. Lenore has no restrictions.
5. So for Monday, either Robert or Lenore could report in the morning, and Lenore could report in the afternoon.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. However, it does not require that if Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo must also be assigned.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This is the converse of the original statement. It would require that if Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo must also be assigned. This is not equivalent to the original constraint.
B, C, E: These choices introduce additional constraints about Landon, Ong and Novetzke that are not related to the original Jaramillo-Kayne constraint. They would change the conditions, not maintain the same effect.
D: This prevents both Jaramillo and Novetzke from being assigned. It allows the possibility of Jaramillo being assigned without Kayne, which the original constraint prohibits. But it correctly prevents Jaramillo from being assigned unless Kayne is also assigned, matching the effect of the original statement.
Therefore, answer choice D has the same effect as the original constraint in determining the assignment of the ambassadors.

1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means the third and fourth solos could both be traditional pieces. 
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. So if the third and fourth are the consecutive traditional pieces, the fourth would have to be performed by Wayne.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly impact the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo before any traditional pieces can be played.
6. With the above conditions, it's possible that Wayne only performs modern pieces in the first and/or second solo, while Zara performs the traditional pieces in the third and fourth solos.

1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This is a given condition.
2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian must review at least 2 plays.
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, as Megregian might review it.
4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s) as each other. This allows for more than two students to review a single play, as long as only two of them review an identical set of plays.
5. Looking at the answer choices, only B and D include both Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane.
6. Answer B has only Kramer and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane, satisfying the condition that exactly two students review the same play(s).
7. Answer D has Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill reviewing Tamerlane. This is possible because while all three review Tamerlane, only two of them (Kramer and O'Neill) might be reviewing exactly the same set of plays.
Therefore, both B and D could be accurate and complete lists of the students who review Tamerlane. However, we can only select one answer.

2. O is placed higher than L, so O must also be on the top shelf with L. 
3. I is placed on the middle shelf, as given.
4. F and M are on the same shelf. Since more books are on the bottom than the top, and the top already has 2 books (L and O), F and M must be on the middle shelf to avoid having more on the top than bottom.
5. So far we have:
   Top: L, O
   Middle: I, F, M

1. No more than four French works are selected. This allows all the answer choices so far.
2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. This still allows all choices.
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. 
- Choice A has 0 Russian novels, so 0 or more French novels works. Still possible.
- Choice B has 1 Russian novel, so 1 or more French novels works. Still possible. 
- Choice C doesn't specify the number of Russian novels. Still possible.
- Choice D doesn't specify the numbers of each type of novel. Still possible.
- Choice E has 2 Russian novels, so 2 or 3 French novels are needed. Still possible.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
- Choice A only has 1 play total. Possible.
- Choice B has both French plays, so the Russian play can't be selected. But it doesn't specify a Russian play, so this is still possible.
- Choice C specifies the Russian play is selected. If both French plays were also selected, this would violate the constraint. But it's possible to select the Russian play and 0 or 1 French plays. So this is still possible.
- Choice D specifies 2 plays total. If these are the 2 French plays, the constraint is met. Possible.
- Choice E only has 1 play total. Possible.
The key constraint is the last one. It means that if both French plays are selected, a Russian play cannot be. Choice C is the only one that would violate this, by forcing the selection of both French plays (to get to 2 total plays) and the Russian play.

3. Oatmeal batch 2 is made the same day as peanut butter batch 1.
4. Sugar batch 2 is made on Thursday.

We know I is on the middle shelf. F and M must be on the bottom shelf since K is higher than F. L must also be on the bottom, since O is higher.
So the bottom shelf has at least F, L, and M. The middle has at least I. 
H, K and O are the remaining books to place. K and O cannot be on the bottom. So the options are:

5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Considering the reflection, a valid arrangement could be:
Space 1: Pharmacy 
Space 2: Shoe store
Space 3: Restaurant
Space 4: Optometrist or Veterinarian
Space 5: Toy store 
Space 6: Optometrist or Veterinarian
Space 7: Restaurant
So with the shoe store in space 2, it IS possible to have a restaurant in space 3, as long as the pharmacy is in space 1 and the other restaurant is in space 7, with the other businesses arranged according to the constraints in the middle spaces.

","You're right, I made an error in my previous reasoning. Let's think through this step-by-step:
Given:
- Reynaldo cannot test F
- Yuki cannot test J 
- Theresa must test H on one of the two days
- The bicycle Yuki tests on day 1 must be tested by Seamus on day 2
- Theresa tests G on day 2
If Theresa tests G on day 2, then she must test H on day 1 (since she has to test H on one of the two days).
Yuki can't test J, so on day 1 he must test either F, G or H. But we know Theresa tests H on day 1. So Yuki must test either F or G on day 1. 
Whichever bike Yuki tests on day 1 (F or G), Seamus must test that same bike on day 2.
The only option remaining is that Reynaldo must test J on day 1, since he can't test F, and G and H are taken on day 1.
Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, then Reynaldo must test J on the first day.

  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, considering all the constraints:
1. The articles cover 3 topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y). 
2. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
3. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
4. S must be earlier than Y.
5. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
6. Y is given to be fourth.
If Y is fourth, then by constraint 4, S must be 1st, 2nd or 3rd. 
- If S is 1st, then Q cannot be 2nd (consecutive nutrition articles), so Q must be 3rd by constraint 3. Then a finance article (G, H, or J) must be 2nd. 
- If S is 2nd, then Q must be 3rd (constraint 3), and a finance article must be 1st.
- If S is 3rd, then Q cannot be 3rd (consecutive nutrition). So this is not possible.
In both possible scenarios (S 1st or 2nd), Q is 3rd. No other position works for Q given the constraints.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, Q must be third.

2. No breed is featured on consecutive days.
3. Breeds featured on day 1 are not featured on day 7.
4. Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or any day with Himalayans.
If Himalayans are not on day 7, they must be on days 2, 4, and 6 to meet the requirement of being featured on exactly 3 non-consecutive days.
This means Rottweilers cannot be on days 2, 4, 6 or 7. They also can't be on day 1 since Greyhounds are.
So Rottweilers can only be featured on day 3 and/or day 5. 
Looking at the answer choices:
A: Greyhounds can't be on days 3 and 5 since they are on day 1 and no breed is on consecutive days. Incorrect.
B: Newfoundlands could be on day 3, so this is possible. 
C: Rottweilers can be on day 6. Incorrect as Himalayans must be on day 6.
D: Rottweilers could be only on day 3, so this is possible.
E: Rottweilers can only be on at most 2 days (3 and 5), not 3 days. Incorrect.

A. Reynaldo tests G on the second day. This is possible and doesn't violate any constraints.
B. Seamus tests F on the first day. Also possible, as Seamus has no specific restrictions.
C. Theresa tests F on the second day. This is NOT possible. If Theresa tests H on day 1 (as required), then she can't test F on day 2 because H must also be tested on day 2 by a different rider. 
D. Reynaldo tests H on the first day. Possible, as Reynaldo is only restricted from testing F.

4. Another condition states that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
5. If Image's voicemail target was 1 day, that would force the other clients' voicemail targets to be 2 days or 3 days. But then their website targets would have to be even shorter to satisfy the first condition, which would contradict the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's.
6. Therefore, the only consistent solution is for Image's voicemail target to also be 2 days. This allows the other clients' voicemail and website targets to be 3 days.

If O is first:
- Positions 2-4 could be any of the remaining compositions except L or H (constraint 4).
- Positions 6-7 must include both P and S in that order (constraints 5 and 6).
- This leaves position 8 for either L or H.
- The remaining 3 compositions including F, R and T in some valid order must fill positions 2-4.
If O is fifth:

- T must be next to either F or R (constraint 1).
- There must be at least 2 compositions between F and R (constraint 2).

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step considering the constraints and my previous reflection:
1. The articles cover three topics: finance (G, H, J), nutrition (Q, R, S), and wildlife (Y). 
2. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
3. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. 
4. S must be earlier than Y.
5. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
If J is third:
- From constraint 5, G must be fourth and R must be fifth. 
- Q and S cannot be first and second (from constraint 3), so either H or Y must be first.
- S must be earlier than Y (constraint 4), so S must be second and Y must be seventh.
- The only remaining position is sixth, which must be H.
So if J is third, the full ordering must be:
1. Q
2. S 
3. J
4. G
5. R
6. H

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know P is performed third and S is performed sixth. 
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since P is third, O cannot be fifth, so O must be first.
3. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
4. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
5. The eighth composition is either L or H.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is first and S is sixth, there must be at least one composition between them (in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th position).
Now, for the 5th position specifically:
- It can't be O (as O is 1st) 
- It can't be P (as P is 3rd)
- It can't be S (as S is 6th)
- It can't be the 8th composition (which is L or H)
Therefore, the 5th composition must be one of: F, R, or T.

2. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone.
3. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. So Zone 3 must have at least 3 reps.
4. Looking at the choices:
A) Kim, Mahr - This is possible. The other 5 reps could be split 2-3 or 3-2 between Zones 1 and 2.
B) Kim, Tiao - This is not possible. If Tiao is in Zone 3, Udall must be in Zone 1 or 3. But then Stuckey would also have to be in Zone 1 or 3, leaving only 2 reps for Zones 1 and 2 combined, which is not enough.
C) Parra, Quinn - This is possible. The other 5 reps could be split 2-3 between Zones 1 and 2.
D) Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This is not possible. Tiao and Udall can't be in the same zone.

3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. But Kayne could still be assigned to Zambia in this case.
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia. 
Now, if Jaramillo is not assigned, then by constraint 2, Kayne is also not assigned. In this case, by constraint 1, Novetzke must be assigned. 
Landon could be either assigned to Zambia (constraint 4) or unassigned. If Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Ong must be assigned to either Venezuela or Yemen. If Landon is unassigned, then Ong must be assigned to both Venezuela and Yemen.

2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. But no specific numbers are given, so this doesn't limit either to only two possible spaces yet.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this means Robertson can only be #3 or #4.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This is already accounted for by the previous conditions.
So in summary:
- Togowa is limited to space #1 or #2

1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that's the only day he can.
2. Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday, because if she did, then Helen and Irving would have to give their reports on Thursday, which is not an option.
3. So Nina must give her report on either Monday or Tuesday. 
4. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. This would mean George cannot give his report on Tuesday, violating the first condition. So Nina cannot give her report on Monday.
5. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Tuesday. This means Helen and Irving give their reports on Wednesday.
6. Robert cannot give an afternoon report. So if he is giving a report, it must be a morning one. 
7. The only remaining day for Robert to give his report is Monday morning.

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. 
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Looking at the choices:
A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
   This violates rule 1 as Young (#1) is not higher than Togowa (#5).
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
   This violates rule 4 as Robertson is assigned #5, not #1-4.
C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
   This violates rule 2 as Xu (#3) is not higher than Souza (#5).
D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
   This violates the inferred rule that Robertson must be higher than Togowa.
E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
   This satisfies all the rules: Young (#3) > Togowa (#2), Xu (#5) > Souza (#1),

4. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
5. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
From constraint 5, Julio and Kevin lead on different days since there is only one morning session per day.
Julio must lead either the Wednesday or Thursday morning session, since his session must be earlier than Olivia's (constraint 4).
If Julio leads Wednesday morning:
- Kevin must lead either Thursday or Friday morning (constraint 1). 
- Olivia must lead Thursday or Friday (constraint 4).
- Lan must lead on the other day from Olivia (constraint 2).

B: If K and G are on the same shelf, they could be either middle or top, leaving many possible arrangements for the other books. So B doesn't fully determine it.
C: If L and F are on the same (bottom) shelf, then M is also bottom (as F and M share a shelf). O must be middle or top. K must be middle or top. This leaves G, H to be distributed, with multiple possible arrangements. So C doesn't fully determine it.
D: If M and H are on the same (bottom) shelf, then F is also bottom (as F and M share a shelf). This forces K, I to be middle and L, O, G to be top, fully determining the arrangement. So D does fully determine the shelving.
E: If H and O are on the same shelf, they could be either middle or top, leaving many possible arrangements for the other books. So E doesn't fully determine it.

Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday (since no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day).
2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. 
3. At least one batch is made on Monday. 
4. Exactly one batch is made on Friday.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A) If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, this satisfies the condition that at least one batch is made on Monday. It's possible the single Friday batch could be either oatmeal or peanut butter in this case.
B) If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, Monday's batch would have to be sugar or peanut butter. But this doesn't definitively violate any conditions.
C) If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, that would be the single Friday batch. But the first and second oatmeal batches plus the peanut butter and sugar batches would have to fit on Mon-Thurs without conflict, which seems difficult but not impossible.
D) and E) If either the first or second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday or Tuesday, that still leaves the other days for the other batches without obvious contradiction.
In summary, only A is definitively possible based on the conditions. The others might work out but would require additional assumptions.

  E: a 3-day website target
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client. This means we need to look for a target that, based on the given conditions, could only apply to one client at most.
2. Let's consider each choice:
A) A 1-day website target could potentially apply to any of the clients. It's not restricted.
B) A 2-day voicemail target could apply to Solide or Truvest, since Image's voicemail target must be the shortest. So this could apply to multiple clients.
C) A 2-day website target could apply to Image or Solide, since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. So this could apply to multiple clients.
D) A 3-day voicemail target could only apply to Solide or Truvest, since Image's voicemail target must be the shortest. But it could still apply to two clients.
E) A 3-day website target could only apply to Truvest. Why? Because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's, and Image's website target can't be longer than its voicemail target (which must be the shortest). So Truvest is the only client that could have a 3-day website target.

  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We're told that none of the clients has a website target of 2 days. This means the website targets can only be 1 day or 3 days.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Since none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day (the shortest possible).
3. If Image's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 3 days, because we're told Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. With Image's website target at 1 day and Solide's at 3 days, choice A ""Image's website target is shorter than Solide's"" must be true.
5. Choice B ""Solide's website target is shorter than Image's"" is impossible given the conditions and constraints.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice A - it could be true that Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.

  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The veterinarian is in space 5.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 6 or 7 to be at one end of the row. It can't be in space 6 because then the toy store would be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7.
3. One of the restaurants must be at the other end from the pharmacy, so it must be in space 1. 
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The second restaurant could be in space 4 or 6. It can't be in space 6 because the pharmacy is in space 7. Therefore, the second restaurant could be in space 4.
5. The optometrist and shoe store must occupy spaces 2 and 3 in some order.
6. The toy store will be in the remaining space, which is space 6.
So in summary, if the veterinarian is in space 5, we can deduce that the pharmacy is in space 7 and one restaurant is in space 1. But we cannot definitively place the other businesses. The second restaurant could be in space 4, but this is not a certainty.
Therefore, none of the answer choices A through E must be true.

1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
2. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. 
3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
From conditions 1 and 2, we know the order is: textiles < livestock < grain
From condition 3, we know: fuel < produce
And from condition 4, textiles and produce must be adjacent.
Looking at the first 3 bays (1-3), the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:
Bay 1: fuel
Bay 2: textiles 
Bay 3: produce

  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step given the constraints:
1. The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This means the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
2. No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. So the other two batches of peanut butter cookies and the other two batches of oatmeal cookies must be made on different days later in the week.
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 
4. At least one batch is made on Monday. Since two batches are already accounted for on Tuesday (peanut butter #1 and oatmeal #2), and one on Thursday (sugar #2), the batch made on Monday must be either sugar #1 or oatmeal #1.
5. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is possible. Sugar #1 and oatmeal #1 could both be made on Monday.
B) This is not possible. We know peanut butter #1 and oatmeal #2 are made on Tuesday, no other first batches can be made that day. 
C) This is not possible. Peanut butter #2 and oatmeal #3 must be made after Tuesday, and sugar #2 is on Thursday, so there cannot be two second batches on Wednesday.
D) This is possible. Sugar #2 is on Thursday and either peanut butter #2 or oatmeal #3 could be as well.
E) This is possible. The remaining two batches not accounted for yet (one of peanut butter and one of oatmeal) could both be made on Friday.
