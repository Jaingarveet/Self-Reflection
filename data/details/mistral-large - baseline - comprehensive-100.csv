Let x be the monthly sales.
The monthly salary S is given by the equation:
S = 500 + 0.05x
We want to find x such that S = 1500.
Substituting S = 1500 in the equation, we get:
1500 = 500 + 0.05x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
1000 = 0.05x
Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get:
x = 20000
Action: Answer(""D"")","Let S be the total monthly salary and x be the monthly sales, hence
S = 500 + 5% * x
Find sales x so that S = 1500, hence
1500 = 500 + 5% * x = 500 + 0.05 x

","Thought:
The length of the fence is the sum of the widths of all the pickets and the spaces between them.
The width of each picket is 1/2 inch, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
So, the total length of the fence in inches is (1/2)x + 6(x-1), where x is the number of pickets.
To convert this length to feet, we divide by 12.
So, the length of the fence in feet is [(1/2)x + 6(x-1)]/12.
Simplifying this expression, we get (13x-12)/24.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12

The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva.

However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. We can also infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. However, we cannot infer that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, since the information does not mention breeds specifically. We also cannot infer that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers, since the information does not mention the intensity of allergic reactions.

The passage discusses the relationship between plants and insects, specifically how secondary substances in plants have evolved in response to insects. These substances can either attract pollinating insects or serve as a defense mechanism against plant-eating insects. Insects, in turn, have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses.

The author would most likely agree with choice D, as it accurately reflects the information presented in the passage. The passage states that secondary substances first appeared as a result of genetic mutations, but were conserved by natural selection because they either attracted pollinating insects or defended against plant-eating insects.

To find the two possible values for $c$, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a(8-a)=15$ and $7 a+16-2 a=c$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=3$ or $c=5$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method.
Multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the first equation:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\4 y-2 x=-38\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$x+8 y=-61$$
Now, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x$$
Substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation:
$$2\left(-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-\frac{122}{8}-\frac{1}{4} x-x=-19$$
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
$$-122-x-4 x=-76$$
Combining like terms, we get:
$$-5 x=46$$
Dividing both sides by $-5$, we get:
$$x=-9.2$$
Substituting $x=-9.2$ into the expression for $y$, we get:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8}(-9.2)=-7.6-1.15=-8.75$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(-9.2,-8.75)$.
However, this is not one of the given choices.

A: $(-5,-2)$
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(-5)+4(-2)=-15-8=-23$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-2)-(-5)=-4+5=1$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ does not satisfy the second equation.
B: $(3,-8)$
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(3)+4(-8)=9-32=-23$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-8)-(3)=-16-3=-19$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the second equation.
C: $(4,-6)$
Substituting $x=4$ and $y=-6$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(4)+4(-6)=12-24=-12$$
Therefore, $(4,-6)$ does not satisfy the first equation.
D: $(9,-6)$

The engineer estimates that the population will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. This means that after 20 years, the population will be 90 percent of what it was before.

To represent this mathematically, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

$P(t) = P\_0 (1 - r)^{t/k}$

where $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$, $P\_0$ is the initial population, $r$ is the rate of decay (as a decimal), and $k$ is the time period over which the decay occurs.

In this case, $P\_0 = 50,000$, $r = 0.1$, and $k = 20$.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$P(t) = 50,000 (1 - 0.1)^{t/20}$

$P(t) = 50,000 (0.9)^{t/20}$

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9.

Multiply both sides by [(1 + r/1200)^N - 1] / [(r/1200)(1 + r/1200)^N] to isolate P:

If the line passes through the origin, then the slope of the line is given by the formula:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two points on the line.

Using the given points (2, k) and (k, 32), we can calculate the slope:

m = (32 - k) / (k - 2)

Since the line passes through the origin, we know that the slope is also given by:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (32 - 0) / (k - 0) = 32/k

Therefore, we have:

32/k = (32 - k) / (k - 2)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

32(k - 2) = k(32 - k)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

32k - 64 = 32k - k^2

Rearranging, we get:

k^2 = 64

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

k = ±8

Since k cannot be negative (since it is a coordinate of a point), we have:

k = 8

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

Now, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate $y$:
$$5 x=10$$
Next, we can solve for $x$:
$$x=2$$
Now, we can substitute $x=2$ into either equation to solve for $y$. We'll use the second equation:
$$3(2)-2 y=-6$$
$$6-2 y=-6$$

$$y=6$$

Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$.

The population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015, so in 2015, the population of City Y was 0.9 \* (population of City Y in 2010).
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, we have:
144,000 = 0.9 \* (population of City Y in 2010)
