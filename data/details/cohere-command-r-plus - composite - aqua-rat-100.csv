Amy needs to create unique codes for 10 different types of books. She can use single letters or letter pairs.

The simplest way to do this is to use the first 10 letters of the alphabet for single-letter codes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. 

This leaves 10 letters unused: K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. 

With these remaining letters, she can create 10 unique pairs (as order does not matter): KL, KM, KN, KO, KP, KQ, KR, KS, KT, LM. 

However, Amy only needs enough letters for 10 unique codes, so she can choose the first 10 letters of the alphabet.

At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

First, calculate the total hours worked by Alex: 
 - Alex's hours = 7 hours/toy * 35 toys = 245 hours

Since Jacob worked almost the same hours, we can assume: 
 - 9 hours/toy * Jacob's toys ~ 245 hours

x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

","Thought: 
Using trigonometry, we can find the distance ($x$) the car has traveled when the angle is $45^\circ$ and then again when it is $60^\circ$. 

$\tan(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = h$
$\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{x - 10} \implies h = (x - 10)\tan(60^\circ)$

Setting these equal to each other and solving for $x$, we get:
$x = h = (x - 10)\tan(60^\circ)$
$x = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$

Now, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:
$x - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} - 1)$

Therefore, it will take $5(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

This will take 30 days. However, on the first day, the frog initially slipped down by 2 meters, so we must add back those 2 meters to our calculation. Therefore, it will take a total of 32 jumps, or 32 days, for the frog to escape the well.

Calculation:
Net gain per day = 3 meters climbed - 2 meters slipped = 1 meter
Total distance to be covered = 30 meters
Number of days = Total distance / Net gain per day = 30 / 1 = 30 days
Accounting for the initial slip: +2 meters (which equates to +2 days)
Total days = 30 days + 2 days = 32 days

So, it will take 32 days for the frog to escape the well.

The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \times 5 = \mathbf{135}$. 

This question requires an understanding of three-dimensional shapes and the ability to visualize the smaller cubes within the larger hollow cube. It also tests attention to detail, as one needs to consider the unpainted faces of the outer layer of smaller cubes.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

Let John's money be represented by the variable x.

According to Mark, if John gives him half of his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, we can set up the equation: 
John's contribution + Mark's original money = Rs. 75
x / 2 + x = 75

According to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will also have Rs. 75. So, we can set up a second equation: 
John's original money + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
x + x / 3 = 75

Now, we can solve for x by isolating it in one of the equations:
x + x / 3 = 75
4x / 3 = 75
x = 75 * 3/4

Let's break down the problem:
Original plan: Total amount to be spent = Rs. 96
Original number of friends = n
Original contribution per friend = Rs. 96 / n

After 4 friends didn't show up:
New number of friends = n - 4
New contribution per friend = (Rs. 96 + Rs. 16) / (n - 4) = Rs. 112 / (n - 4)

Now, we set up an equation to equate the two contributions:
Rs. 112 / (n - 4) = Rs. 96 / n + Rs. 4

Multiplying both sides by (n - 4) to isolate n:
Rs. 112 = Rs. 96 + 4n

Subtracting 96 from both sides:
Rs. 16 = 4n

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, each picket plus the space is 6 + 1/2 = 13/2 inches. 

The total length of the fence is given by (width of picket plus space) * number of pickets.

Therefore, the length of the fence in inches is (13/2)*x inches. 

To convert this length to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in one foot, resulting in (13x/2)/12. 

Simplifying this expression, we get x*(13/24) feet, which can be written as (13x/24) feet.

minor arc AD = 180° - 310° = -130°.

Converting this angle to its positive equivalent:
minor arc AD = 360° + (-130°) = 230°.

So, the measure of minor arc AD is 230°.

Action: Answer(""E"")","B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees. Now , we have arc BD = 150, therefore CD = 70.

Let the distance between A and B be $x$ miles. 
Kevin drives at $70$ mph for $\frac{x}{70}$ hours. 
Then, he immediately drives back at $90$ mph for the same distance, taking $\frac{x}{90}$ hours. 
The total trip time is $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{90} = \frac{16x}{630} = \frac{8x}{315}$ hours. 

$3$ hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, which means he had traveled for $\frac{8x}{315} - 3$ hours. 
During this time, he covered a distance of $70$ miles. 

We can set up the equation as:
$\frac{8x}{315} - 3 = \frac{70}{70}$

The probability of catching the first train can be calculated as follows:

Probability of catching the first train = 1 - (Probability of missing both first trains)

The main line train starts at 5:00, so the first train arrives at 5:00 and the second at 5:10.
The harbor line train starts at 5:02, so the first train arrives at 5:02 and the second at 5:12.

The probability of missing the first main line train is 0.1 (as it arrives every 10 minutes).
The probability of missing the first harbor line train is 0.02 (as it arrives 2 minutes after the hour).

So, the probability of missing both first trains is 0.1 x 0.02 = 0.002.

Therefore, the probability of catching the first train is 1 - 0.002 = 0.998.

The number of students who took neither subject is the remaining percentage, $100\% - 48\% = 52\%$, which is $0.52x$.

We are given that there are more than $501$ students in the school, so we can set up the following inequality: $0.52x > 501$. To solve for $x$, we divide by $0.52$, resulting in $x > 963.46$. Thus, the least possible number of students in the school is a value slightly greater than $963$.

First, simplify the expression for x:
$x = \frac{n^2 + 2\sqrt{n^3} + 8\sqrt{n} + 16}{n + 4\sqrt{n} + 4}$.

To find the range of x, we need to determine the ranges of the numerator and denominator separately.

For the numerator (N), when $n = 36$, $N \approx 4192.08$. When $n = 72$, $N \approx 7369.92$. So, $4192 < N < 7370$.

For the denominator (D), when $n = 36$, $D \approx 104.24$. When $n = 72$, $D \approx 184.48$. Thus, $104 < D < 184$.

Now, to find the range of x, we divide the bounds of N by the bounds of D:
Lower bound of x: $\frac{4192}{184} < x$
Upper bound of x: $\frac{7370}{104} > x$

So, we have $22.78 < x < 70.77$, which matches choice ""D: 28 < x < 60"".

Time = (20 steps / x steps/minute) + extra time at $x$ speed

Time = (10 steps / x steps/minute) + extra time at $x$ speed

Given that the total time for 10 steps is twice the total time for 20 steps:

C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
","Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
","Thought: 
Let C join x months after B.

A's profit for the first 2 months = Rs. 40,000 * 2/12 = Rs. 6,667
A's profit for the remaining 10 months = Rs. 40,000 * 10/12 * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000

B's profit for (12-x) months = Rs. 60,000 * (12-x)/12 * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12

C's profit for x months = Rs. 150,000

Equation: A's profit + B's profit + C's profit = Total profit
Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 75,000 + Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12 + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000

Simplifying the equation:
Rs. 81,667 + Rs. 6,250 * (12-x) + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000

Solving for x, we get x = 4
Action: Answer(""B"")","Assume that C was there in the business for x months
A:B:C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x
= 40*12 : 60*10 : 120x = 40 : 5*10 : 10x
=8 : 10 : 2x
= 4 : 5 : x
C's share = 375000*x/(9+x) = 150000
=> 375x/(9+x) = 150
=> 15x = 6(9+x)
=> 5x = 18 + 2x
=> 3x = 18
=> x = 18/3 = 6
It means C was there in the business for 6 months. Given that B joined the business
after 2 months. Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined
