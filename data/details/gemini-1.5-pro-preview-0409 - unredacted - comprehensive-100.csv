  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Thought:
I will follow the instructions and advice to avoid making the same mistake as before.
Each picket-space unit is 0.5 inches (picket) + 6 inches (space) = 6.5 inches.
There are x pickets, so there are (x-1) spaces.
The total number of units is x pickets + (x-1) spaces = 2x-1 units.
The fence length in inches is 6.5 * (2x-1) = 13x - 6.5 inches.
Converting to feet: (13x - 6.5) / 12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
Action: Answer(""E"") 
","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12
Simplify to get (13X-12)/24

I will follow the instructions and my previous reflection to solve this system of equations accurately.
Step 1: The equations are already set up to eliminate x by adding them together.
Step 2: Add the equations: 
$$10y = -80$$
Step 3: Solve for y:
$$y = -8$$
Step 4: Substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
Step 5: Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).

","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",B,B,1,814,172,986,

Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hydroxylysine The initial step in protein synthesis is the activation of amino acid in which each of the 20 amino-acids is covalently attached to their respective t-RNA, forming specific amino acyl t-RNA.The reaction is catalyzed by aminoacyl t-RNA synthase.Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are not represented into genetic code, i.e. they to not have t-RNA capable of accepting them and inseing them into polypeptide chain. Therefore, they have to be synthesized post-translationally from proline and lysine residues in the polypeptides.",C,C,1,710,54,764,
