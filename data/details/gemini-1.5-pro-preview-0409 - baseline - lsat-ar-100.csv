Analysis:
1.  **Megregian reviews all 3 plays:** This satisfies the condition of reviewing more plays than Kramer and Lopez.  Since Megregian can't review the same plays as Lopez, Lopez must review Sunset and Undulation.  This leaves Tamerlane and one other play for Kramer, and the last play for Jiang.  In this case, **O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang, making D true.**
2.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (not Tamerlane):** This leaves Tamerlane and one other play for both Kramer and O'Neill.  Lopez must review the remaining play.  This scenario is not possible because it would mean three students review the same plays (Kramer, O'Neill, and one of the others). 
3.  **Megregian reviews 2 plays (including Tamerlane):** Kramer and O'Neill must review the remaining play.  Lopez reviews the two plays Megregian didn't.  This scenario is not possible because it would mean three students review the same plays (Kramer, O'Neill, and Lopez).

*   **Condition 2:** S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.

Let's analyze each option:
*   **A: H is fourth:** This doesn't provide enough information to determine the full order.
*   **B: H is sixth:** This means the order for nutrition articles is Q-S-H. Combining with condition 4 (J-G-R), we still don't know the position of Y. 
*   **C: R is fourth:** This means the order for finance articles is J-G-R, and R is followed by a nutrition article (either Q or S). However, we still don't know the exact order of Q, S, and H, nor the position of Y.
*   **D: R is seventh:** This means the order for finance articles is J-G-R. Since R is last, it must be preceded by a nutrition article (either Q or S).  From condition 3 (S before Y), and knowing Y cannot be last, Y must be sixth. This forces S to be fifth and Q to be third. This satisfies condition 2 and fully determines the order: J-?-Q-G-S-Y-R (the ? is H, the remaining nutrition article).

**C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.**

Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
","Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
","Thought:
*   Parra and Quinn work in the same zone. 
*   Either Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1 (but not both).
*   Either Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2 (but not both).
*   Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
*   Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.
From this, we know:
*   If Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1 and Tiao is NOT. This would force Udall into Zone 2 and Stuckey with him. This leaves Zone 3 empty, violating the rule that it must have more representatives than Zone 2. So, Parra CANNOT be in Zone 1.
*   Therefore, Tiao MUST be in Zone 1. This means Parra and Quinn are NOT in Zone 1.
*   Since Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall CANNOT be in Zone 2. This means Udall and Stuckey MUST be in Zone 3.
*   This leaves Parra and Quinn to be in Zone 2.
Therefore, Quinn cannot be with Stuckey (who is in Zone 3).

  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.

  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.

  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
","Thought:
*  We know website targets can't be longer than voicemail targets for the same client.
*  If no website target is 2 days, they must be either 1 or 3 days.
*  Image's voicemail is the shortest, so it can't be 3 days (as the website target can't be longer). So, Image's voicemail must be 1 day, and its website target also 1 day.
*  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since neither can be 2 days, and Image already has the 1-day target, Solide must have a 3-day website target and Truvest a 1-day website target.
*  This leaves Truvest's voicemail to be either 1 or 3 days, and Solide's voicemail to be 3 days.
Analysis of Choices:
*  A: Cannot be true, as we established Image's website target is 1 day, the shortest.
*  B: Cannot be true, as Solide's website target is 3 days.
*  C: Cannot be true, as Solide's voicemail target must be 3 days, longer than Truvest's.
*  D: **This could be true**. Truvest's website target is 1 day, which is shorter than Image's 1-day target (both are the shortest, so it's not ""shorter"" but it fits the wording).
*  E: Cannot be true, as Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 or 3 days, not shorter than Solide's 3 days.

* **C: Rottweilers on day 5:** This is possible as it doesn't contradict any given information.
* **D: Himalayans on day 6:** This is NOT possible. If Himalayans are on day 6, they must also be on day 4 (3 days total, not on consecutive days). This puts Rottweilers on day 7 (not with Himalayans), contradicting the given information.
