The second statement tells us that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

","Thought: 
The argumentative technique used in the context is ""conditionally advocating a factic."" This technique involves presenting an accusation that is less offensive (""unyielding"") while still conveying the same meaning as stronger, more abusive terms. This accusation is conditional because it relies on the acceptance of the premise that group members are not yielding, and thus, it is difficult to deny the conclusion that they are unyielding.

Answer explanation: 
Choice C is the correct answer because it accurately describes the argumentative strategy of presenting an alternative accusation that is less offensive while still making the same point. This strategy is conditional because it relies on the acceptance of a certain premise (not yielding) to support the conclusion (unyielding behavior).

Incorrect choices:
- A and B are incorrect because they involve rejecting a factic, whereas the context involves presenting an alternative factic.
- D is incorrect because the argumentative technique does not directly aim to help the group reach a consensus; it is more focused on making an accusation stick.
- E is incorrect because the argument is not structured as a traditional premise-and-conclusion argument, where one could accept the premise but deny the conclusion. The technique is more about reframing the accusation in a less offensive way while maintaining its validity.

  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.
","Thought: 
The correct answer is choice A. The study found that smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day have the same amount of nicotine in their blood at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes. Choice A explains this by stating that blood can only absorb a certain amount of nicotine per day, which is limited by the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This means that even if smokers use higher-nicotine cigarettes, their blood nicotine levels won't exceed what's achievable with the lowest-nicotine cigarettes, thus resulting in similar blood nicotine levels across all smokers in the study.

  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.
  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.
  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.
  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.
  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

","Thought: The argument presents a flawed pattern of reasoning, specifically a generalization fallacy. It assumes that because most auto mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, all auto mechanics with extensive experience must also understand them. 

Out of the given choices, the argument in option E displays a similar pattern of flawed reasoning. It suggests that because most snow removal companies run lawn-care services, and most of those companies hire additional workers, then it must be true that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This argument makes a similar leap in logic, committing the same generalization fallacy.

  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
","Thought: 
The correct answer choice will explain why congested highways have a lower rate of fatal accidents, focusing on factors that reduce accident severity.

Choice D states that most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at high speeds. This directly addresses the severity of accidents and provides a critical factor in differentiating between non-fatal and fatal accidents.

The statement, ""Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains,"" is a conclusion that supports the argument's main conclusion. It provides a reason why allowing cell phone use on airplanes is problematic and why the proposals are ill-advised. This statement is not the main conclusion itself, but it plays a crucial role in the argument's reasoning by offering a layer of support for the main point.

  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do
","Thought: 
The argument assumes a direct link between individuals' motivations and the societal impact of their actions, suggesting that personal gain motives inherently preclude societal benefits. This assumption is a vulnerability as it overlooks the possibility that actions driven by personal gain can still inadvertently benefit society. 

Choice B highlights this oversight, suggesting that the argument takes for granted that technology commercially viable and beneficial to individuals cannot also be beneficial to society as a whole. This is a critical flaw as it ignores the potential for alignment between individual and societal interests, even if the latter is not the primary motivation. 

Choice E is a potential distraction as it discusses the theoretical versus practical aspects, but this is not the core vulnerability of the argument.

  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
","Thought: The professor's argument centers on the idea that freedom of thought, while important, must be balanced with intellectual discipline to ensure that thinkers fully explore the implications of their ideas and make genuine progress. 

Choice E, ""Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought,"" captures the assumption underlying the professor's conclusion. It suggests that intellectual discipline is a prerequisite for freedom of thought, implying that without discipline, the very freedom of thought advocated for in the argument cannot be achieved. 

The other choices, while related to the broader topic of intellectual progress and freedom of thought, do not directly address the relationship between freedom and discipline as presented in the professor's argument.
