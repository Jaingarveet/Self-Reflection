The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it still employs Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and may distort understanding.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a non-scientific culture.

Reflection: I missed this question because I didn't fully consider the implications of the second version of multicultural education employing Western scientific methods. I focused too narrowly on the idea of a 'neutral stance' and didn't recognize that the methods themselves could be considered value-laden and objectionable to critics.

The connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the idea that bigger firms drive out smaller firms due to increasing returns to scale. 
Choice D undermines this connection by introducing variation in the scale required to achieve increasing returns, meaning that smaller firms may still be able to compete and prevent monopolies from forming.

The critics discussed in the second paragraph argue that understanding a culture through the lens of another culture's perspective is impossible and distorting.

Choice A states that members of one culture cannot understand the values of another culture with different values. This does not align with the critics' argument, as they emphasize the importance of understanding cultures from within their own context, not that it is impossible to understand due to differences. 

Choice B suggests that historical and social circumstances influence the development of a culture's values. This is a broad and relatively uncontroversial statement that is not directly related to the critics' argument about the methods used to understand cultures. 

Choice C proposes that a culture can only be understood from more than one cultural perspective. While the critics argue for understanding a culture from within its own perspective, they do not explicitly state that multiple perspectives from the same culture are necessary. 

Choice D claims that understanding another culture is impossible unless they share the same cultural values. This is contrary to the critics' argument, as they advocate for understanding cultures with different values by recognizing and respecting those differences. 

Choice E suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be fully understood through Western science alone. This aligns with the critics' argument that understanding cultures requires more than just a scientific perspective and should include other forms of discourse.

  E: While many species of insects have evolved ways of circumventing plants' chemical defenses, none has done this through outright immunity to plants' secondary substances.
","Thought: 
The correct answer is Choice A. This is because the passage states that ""the same or similar"" secondary substances ""tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family."" This indicates a direct relationship between the diversity of secondary substances in plants and the number of insect interactions over evolutionary history.

Choice B is incorrect because the passage states that ""a few"" secondary substances benefit insects without harming plants, but the majority of plant-defense substances do cause harm to insects. 

Choice C is incorrect as there is no information in the passage about the number of plant species within families or the number of plant families changing over time. 

Choice D is incorrect because the passage states that secondary substances have appeared in direct response to insects, stating, ""Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today."" 

Choice E is incorrect because the passage focuses on the co-evolution of plants and insects, and their mutual influence on each other's characteristics, rather than outright immunity.

Answer: The diversity of secondary substances in plants is indeed influenced by their interactions with insects over evolutionary history, as presented in Choice A.
