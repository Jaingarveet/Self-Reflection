$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$.

Explanation: 
Following the provided reflection and instructions:
1. Key information: 
    - Population of City X in 2010 = 120,000
    - Population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015
    - Population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015
    - Populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015
2. Define variables:
    - Let x be the population of City Y in 2010
3. Translate into equations:
    - Population of City X in 2015: 1.2 * 120,000 = 144,000
    - Population of City Y in 2015: 0.9 * x
    - Equality in 2015: 144,000 = 0.9 * x
4. Solve for x:
    - x = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000
Therefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. It's given that the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, and that it increased by $20 \%$ from 2010 to 2015 . Therefore, the population of City X in 2015 was $120,000(1+0.20)=144,000$. It's also given that the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$ from 2010 to 2015. If $y$ represents the population of City $Y$ in 2010, then $y(1-0.10)=144,000$. Solving this equation for $y$ yields $y=\frac{144,000}{1-0.10}$. Simplifying the denominator yields $\frac{144,000}{0.90}$, or 160,000 .Choice $A$ is incorrect. If the population of City $Y$ in 2010 was 60,000 , then the population of City $Y$ in 2015 would have been $60,000(0.90)=54,000$, which is not equal to the City $\mathrm{X}$ population in 2015 of 144,000 . Choice B is incorrect because $90,000(0.90)=81,000$, which is not equal to the City X population in 2015 of 144,000. Choice D is incorrect because $240,000(0.90)=216,000$, which is not equal to the City X population in 2015 of 144,000.",C,C,1,986,286,1272,

","Thought: 
Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (HVDRR) is an X-linked dominant disorder.
This means that only one mutated copy of the PHEX gene on the X chromosome is needed for the disease to manifest.
Therefore, males with only one X chromosome are also affected.

  D: Methionine
","Choices:
  A: Proline
  B: Lysine
  C: Hydroxylysine
  D: Methionine
","Thought: 
Hydroxylysine is formed by post-translational modification of lysine, not by direct translation from mRNA.
Therefore, aminoacyl t-RNA is not required for hydroxylysine.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hydroxylysine The initial step in protein synthesis is the activation of amino acid in which each of the 20 amino-acids is covalently attached to their respective t-RNA, forming specific amino acyl t-RNA.The reaction is catalyzed by aminoacyl t-RNA synthase.Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are not represented into genetic code, i.e. they to not have t-RNA capable of accepting them and inseing them into polypeptide chain. Therefore, they have to be synthesized post-translationally from proline and lysine residues in the polypeptides.",C,C,1,674,48,722,

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia. Physical examination reveals a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum, which can be transilluminated.

  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia

  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia
","Action: Answer(""C"")","Varicocele is considered a common cause of male infertility and oligospermia, although it is not clear why the dilation of veins should have such consequences. Testicular atrophy is found only rarely and only in long-standing disease. Surgical resection of varicocele by ligation of the internal spermatic vein often improves reproductive function.
