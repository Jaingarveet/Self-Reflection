Let there be 'n' members in the club.
According to the question, the sum of their ages is 250 years.

The ages can be represented as: 
7, 7 + 3, 7 + 6, ... , 7 + 3(n - 1)

The sum of this arithmetic progression is:
n/2 * [2 * 7 + 3 * (n - 1)] = 250

Simplifying this equation, we get:
7n + 3n^2 - 3n - 500 = 0

Factoring the equation, we get:
3n(n + 50) - 250 = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for n, we find:

  B: The rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended.
  C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.
  D: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases.
  E: The rate of deliberate crimes will tend to vary inversely with the level of law enforcement.
","Thought: 
The author suggests that the two opposing viewpoints on crime deterrence are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach would include elements of both strategies.

The economic principle of utility maximization states that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility, which is influenced by the likelihood and severity of punishment, as well as the potential benefits of legal alternatives.

Statement A suggests that stronger punishments for repeat offenders will reduce recidivism, which aligns with the author's argument about the impact of increasing the expected cost of criminal activity through stricter law enforcement.

Statement B suggests that ending rehabilitation efforts may increase the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity. Rehabilitation can be seen as a way to increase the expected utility of lawful activity, which according to the author, should have a positive effect on reducing deliberate crimes.

Statement C directly applies the author's reasoning about the impact of decreasing the expected utility of lawful activity, suggesting that it would lead to an increase in deliberate crimes.

Statement D suggests that restricting access to economic institutions would increase the rate of deliberate crimes, which again aligns with the author's argument about the impact of reducing the expected utility of lawful activity.

Statement E directly contradicts the author's argument. The author suggests that stronger law enforcement, which increases the expected cost of criminal activity, should reduce deliberate crimes. Statement E suggests the opposite, that an increase in law enforcement will lead to an increase in deliberate crimes.

","Thought: 
Expanding the left side of the equation, we get:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$

Comparing coefficients with the right side, we get:
$ab = 15 \Rightarrow ab = 15$
$7a = c$
$2b = 0$

The last equation is true for any value of $b$, so we can use the equation $a + b = 8$ to get:
$a = 8 - b$

Now, we can plug this into the equation $7a = c$ to get:
$7(8-b) = c$
$56-7b = c$
$-7b+56=c$

This gives us the equation $-7b+56=c$.

Now, we can find the two possible values of $b$ from the equations $ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$. One solution is $a = 3, b = 5$, and the other is $a = 6, b = 2$.

Plugging these values back into the equation $7a = c$, we get:
$c = 3 \times 7 = 21$ for $a = 3$
$c = 6 \times 7 = 42$ for $a = 6$

So, the two possible values of $c$ are 21 and 42.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

We can solve this system of equations using elimination. First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to get rid of the fractions:
$\begin{array}{r}
6x + 8y = -46 \\
8y - 4x = -76
\end{array}$

Now, add the two equations together:
$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
This simplifies to:
$14y = -122$

Dividing by 14, we get:
$y = -\frac{122}{14} = -\frac{61}{7}$

Now that we have the value of $y$, we can plug it into either equation to solve for $x$. Let's use the first equation:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4\left(-\frac{61}{7}\right) = -23$
$3x - \frac{244}{7} = -23$

Now, add 244/7 to both sides and multiply by 7/3:
$3x = -23 + \frac{244}{7}$
$3x = \frac{-161 + 244}{7}$
$3x = \frac{83}{7}$
$x = \frac{83}{21}$

So, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = \left(\frac{83}{21}, -\frac{61}{7}\right)$. 

This can be written as a fraction, but it doesn't match any of the provided options. We can write it as a decimal approximation:

The population decreases by 10% every 20 years, which means in one year, the population decreases by $\frac{10}{20}=5\%$. So, the population after one year is $95\%=0.95$ of the original population.

Therefore, the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^t$

Now, we need to express this in terms of 20 years. So, $t=\frac{1}{20}*20t=0.05*20t$

Substituting, we get the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^{0.05*20t}=50,000(0.95^{20t})^0.05=50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$

So, the final answer is $50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$, which can be written as $50,000(0.9975^5)^{4t}$, and $(0.9975)^5\approx0.95$

Therefore, the expression that best represents the engineer's estimate is $50,000(0.95)^{4t}$.

","Thought: 
The line passing through the points (2, k) and (k, 32) has a slope given by (32-k)/(k-2). Setting k=0, k=4, k=8, and k=16, we find that only when k=0, the denominator of the slope becomes zero, and only then the line passes through the origin.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

  A: -20
  B: $\quad-8$

We can solve this system of equations using elimination.
Multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\
& 6 x-4 y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:
$$9 y - 4 y = -42 - (-12)$$
$$5 y = -30$$
$$y = -6$$

Now, we can find the value of $x$ by substituting $y = -6$ into either equation:
$$2x - 3(-6) = -14$$
$$2x + 18 = -14$$
$$2x = -32$$
$$x = -16$$

Therefore, $x - y = -16 - (-6) = -10$.

Choice B is the closest to the correct answer, but it is not exactly right.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Multiplying each side of the equation $2 x-3 y=-14$ by 3 gives $6 x-9 y=-42$. Multiplying each side of the equation $3 x-2 y=-6$ by 2 gives $6 x-4 y=-12$. Then, subtracting the sides of $6 x-4 y=-12$ from the corresponding sides of $6 x-9 y=-42$ gives $-5 y=-30$. Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is $2-6=-4$.Alternatively, adding the corresponding sides of $2 x-3 y=-14$ and $3 x-2 y=-6$ gives $5 x-5 y=-20$, from which it follows that $x-y=-4$.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are incorrect and may be the result of an arithmetic error when solving the system of equations.

","Choices:
  A: Primary structure
  B: Secondary structure
  C: Teiary structure
  D: Quaternary structure
","Thought: 
Protein structure refers to the different levels of organization of a protein molecule.
Primary structure refers to the linear sequence of amino acids, which is determined by the nucleic acid sequence of the gene that codes for the protein.
Secondary structure refers to local spatial patterns in the polypeptide chain, including alpha helices and beta sheets.
Tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, including all the atoms in that chain.
Quaternary structure refers to the structure formed by multiple polypeptide chains, either from the same protein or from different proteins, that function as a multimer.

Denaturation refers to the process by which a protein loses its native tertiary or quaternary structure, typically due to exposure to extreme environmental conditions such as heat, acid, or chemical treatment. This process generally results in the loss of the protein's biological activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the primary structure of a protein is not lost during denaturation.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Ans. is 'a' i.e., Primary structure The term denaturation refers to disruption of higher order (secondary, teiary and quaternary) structure of protein.All non-covalent bonds that maintain higher order structure are disrupted, but peptide bond (covalent bond) remains intact. Thus, the primary structure is not altered during denaturation, i.e., amino acid sequence is not altered, but denaturation may completely disrupt secondary, teiary and quaternary structure, e.g., denaturated oligomeric proteins dissociated into subunits, each with a randam coil formation.Denaturation is always accompanied by a loss of biological function, e.g., enzymes are inactivated and antibodies fail to act with antigens.Denaturation is generally irreversible, e.g., boiled egg does not regain its original form when kept in cold.Denatured proteins are less soluble and in many cases they precipitate.",A,A,1,262,213,475,
