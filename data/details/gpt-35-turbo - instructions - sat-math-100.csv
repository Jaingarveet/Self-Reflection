Since the line passes through the origin, we have $y = mx$.

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$.

11. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6}$.","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $a x+2 y=4$ are represented by the expression $-\frac{a}{2}$ and the point $(0,2)$, respectively. The value of $a$ can be found by setting the two slopes equal to each other, which gives $-\frac{a}{2}=3$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by -2 gives $a=-6$. When $a=-6$, the lines are parallel and have different $y$-intercepts. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because these values of $a$ would result in two lines that are not parallel, and therefore the resulting system of equations would have a solution.",,A,0,587,402,989,

Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error and it will affect the mean more than the median or range. The mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median and range are not. To calculate the mean, we sum all the values and divide by the number of values. To calculate the median, we arrange the values in order and find the middle value. To calculate the range, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

We know that the total number of left-handed students is 18 and the total number of right-handed students is 122. Therefore, we can set up two equations:
\begin{align*}
\text{Left-handed students: } & \text{Female: } 1f + 1m = 18 \\
& \text{Male: } 1f + 1m = 0 \\
\text{Right-handed students: } & \text{Female: } 5f + 0m = 5x \\
& \text{Male: } 0f + 9m = 122
\end{align*}
We can solve for $m$ in the fourth equation: $9m = 122 \Rightarrow m = \frac{122}{9}$. We can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $f$: $1f + 1\left(\frac{122}{9}\right) = 0 \Rightarrow f = -\frac{122}{9}$. This is not a valid solution, so we made a mistake somewhere. We can check our work by solving for $x$ in the fourth equation: $5f + 0m = 5x \Rightarrow 5f = 5x \Rightarrow f = x$. This means that the number of right-handed female students is equal to the number of left-handed female students. We can use this information to solve for $f$ in the first equation: $1f + 1m = 18 \Rightarrow f + \frac{122}{9} = 18 \Rightarrow f = \frac{40}{3}$. Now we can find the total number of female students: $f + \frac{122}{9} = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{122}{9} = \frac{218}{9}$. Finally, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female: $\frac{5f}{5f + 9m} = \frac{5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right)}{5\left(\frac{40}{3}\right) + 9\left(\frac{122}{9}\right)} = \frac{40}{218} \approx 0.1835$.

Let x be the number of pears produced by Type B trees.
Then, 144 is 20% more than x.
Using the percent decrease formula, we have:
20% = (144 - x) / x
Multiplying both sides by x, we get:

The desired event is the probability of selecting a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older.
We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to calculate the probability of the desired event.
Let A be the event of selecting a female under age 40 and B be the event of selecting a male age 40 or older.
P(A) = 8/25 (from the table)
P(B) = 5/25 (from the table)
To calculate P(A and B), we need to find the number of people who are both female under age 40 and male age 40 or older. Since this is impossible, P(A and B) = 0.

","Thought:
Let's assign the unknown variable to the number of students in the class.
From the problem, we know that if each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, there will be 5 milliliters left over. This can be represented as:
$n \equiv 5 \pmod{3}$
where $n$ is the total amount of solution in milliliters.
We also know that if each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl will need an additional 21 milliliters. This can be represented as:
$n + 21 = 4s$
where $s$ is the number of students in the class.
We can use the first equation to solve for $n$ in terms of $s$:
$n = 3k + 5$
where $k$ is some integer.
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
$3k + 5 + 21 = 4s$
$3k + 26 = 4s$
$4s - 3k = 26$
We can see that $s$ must be greater than or equal to 7, since Mr. Kohl needs at least 21 additional milliliters of solution to give each student 4 milliliters. We can also see that $s$ must be less than or equal to 26, since Mr. Kohl has only $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute.
We can use trial and error to find a value of $s$ that satisfies the equation. Starting with $s = 7$, we get:
$4s - 3k = 26$
$4(7) - 3k = 26$
$28 - 3k = 26$
$3k = 2$
$k = \frac{2}{3}$
This is not an integer value of $k$, so $s = 7$ does not work. Trying $s = 8$, we get:
$4s - 3k = 26$
$4(8) - 3k = 26$
$32 - 3k = 26$
$3k = 6$
$k = 2$
This is an integer value of $k$, so $s = 8$ works. Therefore, there are 8 students in the class.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Let $c$ be the number of students in Mr. Kohl's class. The conditions described in the question can be represented by the equations $n=3 c+5$ and $n+21=4 c$. Substituting $3 c+5$ for $n$ in the second equation gives $3 c+5+21=4 c$, which can be solved to find $c=26$.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the values given for the number of students in the class cannot fulfill both conditions given in the question. For example, if there were 16 students in the class, then the first condition would imply that there are $3(16)+5=53$ milliliters of solution in the beaker, but the second condition would imply that there are $4(16)-21=43$ milliliters of solution in the beaker.

- Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution.
To Find: How many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must Clayton use?
Solution:
Let $x$ be the number of milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton must use.
Then, the number of milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton uses is $100$.
Using the given equation, we can solve for $x$:

Simplifying the equation:
$$0.10 x+20=0.18 x+18$$
$$0.08 x=2$$

Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Answer: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. It's given that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass solution, so $y=100$.

One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
One football field is approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
Therefore, one ounce of graphene can cover $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
48 ounces of graphene can cover $48 \times 7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
Action: 
$48 \times 7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = 336 \text{ acres}$
Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. It is given that 1 ounce of graphene covers 7 football fields. Therefore, 48 ounces can cover $7 \times 48=336$ football fields. If each football field has an area of $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres, then 336 football fields have a total area of $336 \times 1 \frac{1}{3}=448$ acres. Therefore, of the choices given, 450 acres is closest to the number of acres 48 ounces of graphene could cover.Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of dividing, instead of multiplying, the number of football fields by $1 \frac{1}{3}$. Choice $B$ is incorrect and may be the result of finding the number of football fields, not the number of acres, that can be covered by 48 ounces of graphene.

  D: $P=\left(\frac{1,200}{r}\right) m$
","Self-reflection:
The formula given is used to calculate the monthly payment needed to pay off a loan. We need to isolate the variable $P$. 
1. The given formula is: $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$
2. Multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side: $$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right) P$$
3. Distribute the left-hand side: $$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\frac{r}{1,200} P$$
4. Isolate the variable by dividing both sides by the coefficient of the variable: $$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\frac{r}{1,200}}$$
5. Simplify the expression: $$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\frac{r}{1,200}}=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\frac{r}{1,200}}-m\cdot\frac{1}{\frac{r}{1,200}}=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$$
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
