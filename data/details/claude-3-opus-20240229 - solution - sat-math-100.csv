Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","You're right, I previously made a mistake on this question. Let me think through it again step-by-step:
1) $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ can be rewritten as $(9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$ using the property of exponents $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$
2) $9^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9}$, which is the fourth root of 9
3) $\sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{\sqrt{9}} = \sqrt{3}$  (since the square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 3 is $\sqrt{3}$)
4) Therefore, $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt{3})^3$
5) $(\sqrt{3})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$
So the correct answer is D: $3\sqrt{3}$
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Since 9 can be rewritten as $3^{2}, 9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $3^{2^{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}}$. Applying the properties of exponents, this can be written as $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$, which can further be rewritten as $3^{\frac{2}{2}}\left(3^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, an expression that is equivalent to $3 \sqrt{3}$.Choices $A$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$. Choice $C$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$.",D,D,1,524,264,788,

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $3x - y = 12$.
2) The expression we want to evaluate is $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. Let's simplify this:
   $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
3) Now, the exponent in the simplified expression, $3x-y$, is exactly the same as the left-hand side of the given equation.
4) Since $3x - y = 12$, we can substitute 12 for $3x-y$ in the simplified expression:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
5) Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. One approach is to express $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ so that the numerator and denominator are expressed with the same base. Since 2 and 8 are both powers of 2 , substituting $2^{3}$ for 8 in the numerator of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ gives $\frac{\left(2^{3}\right)^{x}}{2^{y}}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$. Since the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$ have a common base, this expression can be rewritten as $2^{3 x-y}$. It is given that $3 x-y=12$, so one can substitute 12 for the exponent, $3 x-y$, given that the expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is equal to $2^{12}$. Choice B is incorrect. The expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$, or $2^{3 x-y}$. If the value of $2^{3 x-y}$ is $4^{4}$, which can be rewritten as 28 , then $2^{3 x-y}=2^{8}$, which results in $3 x-y=8$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. If the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is $8^{2}$, then $2^{3 x-y}=8^{2}$, which results in $3 x-y=6$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be determined.",A,A,1,587,244,831,

His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$

  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know Alan currently drives 100 miles per week on average.
2) His car gets 25 miles per gallon (mpg) on average. 
3) At $4 per gallon, for 100 miles he currently spends:
   (100 miles / 25 mpg) * $4/gal = $16 per week on gas
4) If he wants to reduce his spending by $5 to $11 per week, 
   at $4/gal that means reducing his gas consumption by:
   $5 / ($4/gal) = 1.25 gallons
5) At 25 mpg, 1.25 gallons less gas means driving:
   1.25 gal * 25 mi/gal = 31.25 miles less
6) So if $m$ is the number of miles less he should drive, 
   to save $5, this equation must be true:
   ($m$ miles / 25 mpg) * $4/gal = $5
7) Solving algebraically:
   $m$ / 25 = 5/4
   $m$ = 25 * 5/4 = 125/4 = 31.25
   
8) Rearranging the equation from step 6:
   $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
This matches choice D.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Since gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, and since Alan's car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon, the expression $\frac{4}{25}$ gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car.Multiplying $\frac{4}{25}$ by $m$ gives the cost for Alan to drive $m$ miles in his car. Alan wants to reduce his weekly spending by $\$ 5$, so setting $\frac{4}{25} m$ equal to 5 gives the number of miles, $m$, by which he must reduce his driving.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect. Choices $A$ and $B$ transpose the numerator and the denominator in the fraction. The fraction $\frac{25}{4}$ would result in the unit miles per dollar, but the question requires a unit of dollars per mile. Choices $A$ and $C$ set the expression equal to 95 instead of 5, a mistake that may result from a misconception that Alan wants to reduce his driving by 5 miles each week; instead, the question says he wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\$ 5$.",D,D,1,713,355,1068,
