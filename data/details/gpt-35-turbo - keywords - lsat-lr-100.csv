The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most patients in the group that received magnets reported a significant reduction in pain. To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the causal relationship between the magnets and the reduction in pain. 
Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
Choice B is also irrelevant because the argument is not about whether medication is more effective than magnets.
Choice C is not a strong counter-argument because the experiment was specifically designed to test the effect of magnetic fields on chronic back pain, not pain in other areas.
Choice D is not a strong counter-argument because the involvement of the scientists who designed the experiment does not necessarily invalidate the results.
Choice E is the strongest counter-argument because the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment suggests that factors other than the magnets could have contributed to the reduction in pain.

","Thought:
The argument assumes that technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit. This is a false assumption as there are many examples of technological advances that have been motivated by societal benefit. Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds of a false assumption.

","Thought:
The conclusion drawn by the professor is that the argument for freedom of thought fails because intellectual discipline is needed to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas. Therefore, the assumption that must be made is related to this conclusion.
Option A is not related to the conclusion.
Option B is not related to the conclusion.
Option C contradicts the conclusion.
Option D is not related to the conclusion.
Option E supports the conclusion that intellectual discipline is needed for freedom of thought.

  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.

","Thought:
The argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate an identical penalty for both crimes. To strengthen the argument, we need to find an answer that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is indeed equal to the harm resulting from bribery.
Action: Answer(""D"") 
Explanation: 
Choice D states that in most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed. This answer directly supports the argument that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery. Therefore, it is the best answer to strengthen the argument.",,D,A,0,536,144,680,
