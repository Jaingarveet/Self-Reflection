This is because developed countries benefit from an improved natural environment, while developing countries, despite suffering environmental pollution, are compensated by solving employment issues and increasing taxes. This doesn't necessarily mean that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries (A), or that the degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious (C). The statement also doesn't imply that polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries (D).

However, X is in the sales department, but W is not in the production department, which violates condition 3. So, A is not the correct answer.
B: F is not in the production department, which violates condition 4. So, B is not the correct answer.

D: F is in the production department, which meets condition 4. H and Y are in the same department, which meets condition 1. F and G are not in the same department, which meets condition 2. X is not in the sales department, so condition 3 does not apply. So, D is the correct answer.

Since F and M are not in charge of the same department, and F and G are not in charge of the same department, it means that F must be in charge of a department with either H or I.
