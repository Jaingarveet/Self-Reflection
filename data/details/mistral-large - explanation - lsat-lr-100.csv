  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
","Thought:
The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. The museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection and some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
The correct answer must be true based on the curator's statements.
Action: Answer(""B"")
Explanation:
The curator's statements indicate that all works displayed in the museum are twentieth-century works. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store must be a copy of a twentieth-century work.

  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Reflection:
The question asks for the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection. Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to receive warning if a ninja were in the house, implying that ninjas were a significant threat during the Tokugawa period. Patricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas.

To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to provide evidence that the squeaky floors were not necessarily a response to a perceived threat from ninjas.

Choice B is the strongest counter to Tamara's objection because it suggests that the squeaky floors were not an effective defense against ninjas, and therefore, their presence in wealthy Japanese homes does not necessarily indicate a fear of ninjas.

Option A is not necessarily true, as the information does not mention any regulations.
Option B is likely true, but it is not directly stated in the information.
Option C is not supported by the information, as it only states that higher levels of carbon dioxide make it easier for airborne illnesses to spread, not that low levels make it impossible.
Option D is not necessarily true, as the information does not mention the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.
Option E is most likely true, as the information states that the rate of cabin air replenishment was reduced in 1985, leading to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
