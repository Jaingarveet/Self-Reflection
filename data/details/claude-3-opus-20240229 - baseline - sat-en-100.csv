  D: Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned. 40
","Let's analyze the key points in each passage:
Passage 1 (Douglas):
- Douglas criticizes Lincoln for saying the government and Constitution are contrary to God's law because they allow slavery. 
- Douglas argues the Union has prospered despite being divided into free and slave states.
- He believes the Union can continue to exist and expand if each state is allowed to decide its own affairs regarding slavery.
Passage 2 (Lincoln): 
- Lincoln clarifies that he believes the variety in state laws, such as those regulating sugar and flour production, are not problematic and actually strengthen the Union.
- However, he argues slavery is different and has always caused quarrels and difficulties. 
- He suggests the spread of slavery into new territories is the root cause of the troubles, not its mere existence where currently allowed.
The central tension seems to be that Douglas criticizes Lincoln's stance on the Constitution permitting slavery, while Lincoln argues Douglas has misrepresented his position. Lincoln clarifies he doesn't see all differences in state laws as problematic, only the issue of slavery's expansion.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",C,C,1,1275,243,1518,

  D: require skills similar to those needed to run a country or a business.
","To determine what the authors of Passage 1 believe about running a household and raising children, let's analyze the relevant parts of the passage:
1. The authors state that women's ""delicate constitutions, their peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood, set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties, and summon them to gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" (lines 27-31).
2. They also argue that ""the great conserving principle of Societies, which makes the division of powers a source of harmony, has been expressed and revealed by nature itself, when it divided the functions of the two sexes in so obviously distinct a manner"" (lines 32-36).
From these statements, we can infer that the authors believe:
- Running a household and raising children are suited to women's nature and abilities.
- These roles are distinct from the more strenuous duties performed by men.
- This division of roles between the sexes is natural and leads to social harmony.
The authors do not suggest that household and childrearing tasks are rewarding for men, require skills similar to running a country or business, or are easy and pleasant. Rather, they imply that these roles are less demanding and important than the roles performed by men.

1. Mrs. Quabarl says she wants the children ""not only to be TAUGHT, but INTERESTED in what they learn."" This suggests she values active engagement over mere rote learning.
2. She gives the example of history lessons, where she wants the children to ""feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory."" Again, this emphasizes engaging with the material rather than just memorizing facts.
3. For French, she expects the governess to talk to the children in French at mealtimes several days a week. This is an active, immersive approach to language learning.
4. The other choices don't seem to be supported by the passage:

2. In 1999, they further investigated the characteristics of these CT fibers and found that they were sensitive to slow, gentle tactile stimulation but unresponsive to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
3. The researchers wondered why humans would have fibers that respond only to a narrow range of subtle stimuli.
4. They found that CT fibers were only present in hairy skin, not in hairless skin like the palms and soles of the feet.
5. Olausson wanted to know if CT fibers could distinguish where the brush touches the arm, discern between different textures, and convey a pleasant sensation.
Based on this information, the most likely goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey (choice A). The researchers were trying to understand the specific role of these fibers and the type of information they relay.
The other choices are not as strongly supported by the passage:
- The relationship between body hair and CT fiber function (choice B) was a finding, but not the main goal of the experiment.
- The role of CT fibers in pain perception (choice C) was not a focus, as the fibers were found to be unresponsive to noxious stimuli.
- The effect of microneurography on CT fiber signaling (choice D) was a technique used, but not the goal of the experiment.

3. The study found no structural differences in the brains of mental athletes compared to the control group. Mental athletes also scored within the normal range on cognitive ability tests.
4. However, fMRI scans showed that mental athletes activated different brain regions, particularly those involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, when memorizing information.

Given this information, textbook authors in the early 1990s would have likely expected that blocking fast fibers would impair the ability to perceive vibrations (choice D). 
The passage states that pressure and vibration sensations were thought to be transmitted solely by fast-conducting fibers. Therefore, blocking these fibers would be expected to disrupt the perception of vibrations.

","To determine why Mill suggests gender roles are resistant to change, let's analyze the relevant parts of Passage 2:
1. Mill states that the relationship between men and women was ""sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new"" (lines 55-57).
2. He explains this is because ""in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated"" (lines 57-61).
3. Earlier, Mill notes that ""inequality was [society's] very basis"" until recent generations (lines 44-45), and that ""to be equals was to be enemies"" (line 47).
Considering these points, Mill suggests gender roles are resistant to change because they are deeply ingrained in society's traditions and feelings. The long-standing association of gender roles with the fundamental organization of society has made them especially difficult to change, even as other inequalities have diminished.
While choice A relates to this point, it doesn't capture the full essence of Mill's argument, which emphasizes the emotional and traditional attachment to gender roles. Choices C and D are not strongly supported by the passage.
Therefore, choice B - ""are matters of deeply entrenched tradition"" - best encapsulates Mill's suggestion for why gender roles are resistant to change.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 2, Mill suggests that social roles are resistant to change in part because of their being entrenched in the cultural tradition: ""for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated."" In the context of a discussion of equality between men and women, Mill's statement serves to imply that gender roles change so slowly precisely because they are so deeply ingrained in society and culture.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although Mill suggests in Passage 2 that gender roles are deeply entrenched, she does not imply that they serve as the foundation of society. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not address the issue of legislative reforms, only societal ones. Choice D is incorrect because although Mill addresses the difficulty of reforming traditional gender roles, she does not attribute it to the benefits that certain groups or institutions derive from those roles.",B,B,1,1281,300,1581,

2. It also describes the history book Lymie is reading while eating, including the notes and markings left by previous readers.
3. The paragraph does not focus on introducing Lymie as the main character, nor does it provide clear details that indicate the date. 
4. While it mentions Lymie reading about the Peace of Paris of 1814, which is expanded upon later, this seems more a detail of what he's reading rather than the main purpose of the paragraph.
5. The primary focus of the paragraph seems to be setting the scene by describing the restaurant and the book Lymie is reading there.
Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to convey the passage's setting by describing a place (the Alcazar Restaurant) and an object (the history book).

  C: Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities.
  D: Women are superior to men, but tradition requires women to obey men.
","To determine Beecher's point about the status of women relative to men, let's analyze the key statements in Passage 1:
1. ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" - This suggests Beecher believes women have a lower status than men.
2. ""It is therefore as much for the dignity as it is for the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation"" - Beecher argues women should accept their subordinate role.
3. ""But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" - Although subordinate, Beecher claims women's duties and influence are just as important as men's.
Among the given choices, B most closely matches Beecher's view. Beecher asserts that women are inferior to men in status, but play a role that is as significant as the role played by men.
The other choices are not supported by the passage. Beecher does not discuss women's dependence on men for safety (A), compare women's rights and responsibilities to men's (C), or suggest women are superior to men (D).
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer.

2. Women have recently gained the opportunity to join this procession.
3. The author asks whether women should join the procession and on what terms.
4. The author urges women to think critically about the civilization they are joining and the professions they will pursue.
The passage focuses on the critical decision women face about how to engage with the male-dominated institutions and professions now open to them. The author doesn't argue that women must give up traditional roles, that the male monopoly on power has had grave effects, or that women's entry into power will necessarily transform those positions.

  D: Published theories of scientists who developed earlier models of the Venus flytrap
","To determine which type of evidence Volkov and his colleagues relied on most, let's analyze the relevant information from the passage:
1. Volkov and his colleagues demonstrated that electricity causes the Venus flytrap to close by applying electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, making it close without touching the trigger hairs.
2. They modified the experiment by altering the amount of electrical current to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
3. They found that as long as fourteen microcoulombs of charge flowed between the two electrodes within twenty seconds, the trap would close, whether it came as one large burst or a series of smaller charges.
Based on these details, it's clear that Volkov and his colleagues primarily relied on information obtained from their own experiments, where they monitored the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current. They did not appear to extensively use mathematical models, analysis of previous researchers' data, or published theories of earlier models.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The second sentence of the last paragraph says that the focus of Volkov's work was the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism. The paragraph goes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant and ""altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close."" It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple ""published theories"" or ""earlier models""; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model.",C,C,1,1269,222,1491,

3. Ken's son Terry observed that the birds were ""cheating"" by running up the sides of hay bales while flapping their wings, instead of flying up to the perches.
4. This unexpected observation was the ""aha"" moment for Ken, leading him to realize that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively.
5. Ken modified the study by having the birds run up ramps at increasing angles and filmed them. He discovered that they used their wings for traction, not lift, a technique he named wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
6. The results were interpreted in an evolutionary context, providing explanations for the origin of the flapping flight stroke in birds and the function of half-formed wings.

- Miss Spivey assumed the students would be familiar with Columbia University, which seems to be an overestimation of their knowledge.
- Miss Spivey avoided Ralphord's eye after this interaction, suggesting she may have been a bit dismissive or didn't want to encourage further questions from him.

2. It points out that under this Constitution, the U.S. has expanded its territory and grown in population, wealth, and power.
3. The author believes the Union can continue to exist forever with both free and slave states, as long as each state is allowed to regulate its own affairs without interference.
4. The passage mentions the need to acquire new territory as the nation grows, to provide land for the increasing population.
Considering these points, the passage seems to suggest that the Constitution's provisions for slavery anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories (choice B). The author argues the current system has allowed for territorial expansion thus far and can continue to do so.

It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states.

2. If this complementary pairing holds true, we would expect the percentage of adenine to be close to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine to be close to the percentage of cytosine.
3. Looking at the data for sea urchin DNA:
   - Adenine: 32.8%
   - Guanine: 17.7% 
   - Cytosine: 17.3%

","To determine the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of U.S. growth in the first paragraph, let's analyze the key points:
1. Douglas mentions that despite the division into free and slave states, the U.S. has grown significantly in terms of territory, population, wealth, and power.
2. He contrasts this growth with Lincoln's view that a nation divided into free and slave states ""cannot stand"" and is ""contrary to the law of God.""
3. Douglas then questions Lincoln's authority and wisdom in making such a claim, given the nation's success thus far.
The central idea seems to be that the U.S. has thrived despite the division Lincoln sees as unsustainable. This suggests that Douglas is arguing that the free/slave state divide does not threaten the Union's stability or future.
While the paragraph touches on expansion and Lincoln's knowledge, those don't appear to be the main focus. The U.S. being seen as powerful and admirable is mentioned, but more as evidence against Lincoln's position than as the primary point.
Therefore, the main purpose of this part of Douglas's argument is best captured by choice B: to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer.

  D: unfriendly.
","Choices:
  A: outspoken.
  B: tactful.
  C: ambitious.
  D: unfriendly.
","Let's analyze the passage to determine how other people regarded Lady Carlotta:
1. Lady Carlotta interfered on behalf of a distressed animal, despite her acquaintances advising her that it was ""none of her business."" This suggests she is outspoken and not afraid to act on her beliefs.
2. She once refused to help a lady who was trapped by a boar-pig for three hours, causing her to lose the lady's friendship. This implies she can be uncompromising in her principles, even if it makes her appear unfriendly.
3. When Mrs. Quabarl assumed she was the new governess, Lady Carlotta went along with it, saying ""Very well, if I must I must"" to herself. This hints at a certain boldness and willingness to take on new roles.
4. Lady Carlotta openly disagreed with Mrs. Quabarl about speaking Russian and expressed her preference for certain car makes, causing Mrs. Quabarl to feel discomfited. This further emphasizes her outspokenness and unwillingness to simply agree with others to be tactful.
Considering these points, the passage most clearly implies that other people regarded Lady Carlotta as outspoken. She demonstrates boldness, principles, and a willingness to express her thoughts directly, even if it might offend others or make her appear unfriendly at times.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. In lines 10-14, the narrator states that some of Lady Carlotta's acquaintances would often admonish, or criticize, Lady Carlotta for meddling in or openly expressing her opinion on other people's affairs.

The author emphasizes that women, who have recently joined the ""procession"" of educated men, must consider serious questions about the nature and direction of civilization. She urges women to think critically about their roles and the social conventions they participate in, highlighting the limited time they have to do so. The passage conveys a sense of pressing importance and the need for immediate contemplation and action.

  A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
  B: unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs.
  C: inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality.
  D: at odds with the principles of American democracy.
","To determine what both authors would most likely agree on, I'll analyze each passage's main points about gender roles and equality:
Passage 1:
- Democracy is making men and women more equal
- Some believe men and women should have the same roles and rights, but the author thinks this would ""degrade"" both sexes
- Americans believe men and women have different roles based on their different ""constitutions"", and each should fulfill their role as best they can
Passage 2: 
- Society used to be based on inequality, but now things are moving towards ""a just equality""
- The relationship between men and women has been the slowest to change
- All occupations should be open to everyone, and experience will show who is most capable in each role
- Arbitrarily limiting what roles people can take based on sex is an injustice to the individual and society
Both authors describe changes in gender roles as part of a broader societal shift towards greater equality in general. Passage 1 discusses this in the context of democracy, while Passage 2 frames it as society outgrowing inequality as its basis.
While the authors may disagree on the extent to which gender roles should be differentiated, they both situate changes in gender roles within a larger movement towards equality.
Therefore, the answer choice both authors would most likely agree with is:
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general. This can be seen in the first paragraph of Passage 1, where Tocqueville explains that raising woman to be ""more and more the equal of man"" is part of the overall ""social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant,"" and in the first paragraph of Passage 2, where Mill writes that ""mankind have outgrown"" the state of inequality and ""now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality,"" with gender roles being the last of these relations to undergo such a shift.Choice B is incorrect because although in Passage 1 Tocqueville argues that there are costs to treating men and women the same, in Passage 2 Mill characterizes gender equality as a source of benefits only. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither author considers changing gender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead on questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people's potential. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Mill does not discuss the issue in terms of American democracy, though Tocqueville does.",A,A,1,1276,299,1575,

2. The first space miners ""also hope to build an off-planet economy free of any bonds with Earth, in which the materials extracted and processed from the moon and asteroids are delivered for space-based projects."" (lines 25-28)
3. ""Water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield."" (lines 35-37)
4. ""Splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary refuelling stations."" (lines 37-40)
5. ""Companies are eyeing the iron, silicon, and aluminium in lunar soil and asteroids, which could be used in 3D printers to make spare parts or machinery."" (lines 40-43)

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy over slavery has historically been ""excited by the effort to spread [slavery] into new territory,"" as in the case of Missouri, Texas, and ""the territory acquired by the Mexican War."" Therefore, it can be said that, notwithstanding their differences of opinion, both Douglas and Lincoln discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to the expansion of the Union.

","To determine how the narrator is portrayed, let's look at key details from the passage:
1. The narrator notices many details about her father's shop, like the polished floors, shiny glass cases, and the artful arrangement of the ink. She says ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy."" This shows she is observant and attentive.
2. She recalls Precious Auntie's teachings about ink having purpose and meaning. This memory is triggered by watching her father discuss the ink with a customer. She seems absorbed in this scene.
3. At the end, the narrator feels ""very proud"" to hear her father describe their family's ink with such high praise. Her focus remains on this interaction.
Throughout the passage, the narrator comes across as someone who is closely observing and reflecting on her current environment and experience in her father's shop. She notices many visual details and carefully listens to her father's sales pitch.
Therefore, the best answer is B: the narrator is portrayed as someone attuned to her immediate surroundings.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop.

Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit.

  B: A large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably.

  C: A large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. According to Hodick and Sievers's model, the Venus flytrap requires a high concentration of calcium ions to close its trap.
2. This high concentration is achieved when an insect touches two trigger hairs within a short period of time (about 20 seconds).
3. If the second touch happens quickly after the first, the calcium concentration will be high enough to close the trap.
4. However, if the second touch doesn't happen quickly, the calcium ion concentrations will dissipate over time.
5. If the calcium levels have diminished too much before the second touch, the total concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap.
Looking at the choices:
A. This would result in the trap closing, so it's not the correct answer.
B. This matches the scenario where the trap would not close, because the calcium levels have diminished too much before the second touch.
C. The opening of calcium channels alone is not enough to close the trap, so this is not the correct answer.
D. If the second touch occurs within 10 seconds, the calcium levels should still be high enough to close the trap, so this is not the correct answer.
Therefore, the best answer is B.

But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",B,B,1,1310,291,1601,

3. Through Eppie, Silas reawakens his senses and reconnects with the world around him. His ""enfeebled spirit"" finds refuge in her ""little world.""
4. As Eppie grows and develops, Silas' soul also begins ""unfolding"" and ""trembling gradually into full consciousness."" Her influence gathers force each year.
5. Eppie's mischief tests Silas' patience but also strengthens his ""watchfulness and penetration."" The ""incompatible demands of love"" challenge him.
The passage emphasizes the transformative impact Eppie has on Silas, with her childlike wonder and love helping to restore his numbed spirit. This aligns best with the theme of the restorative power of parental love.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom.""

A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

The author argues that women are denied education and freedom, which prevents them from being virtuous and understanding their duties. She states that ""the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations"" (lines 58-60).
She also questions the idea that men can decide what is best for women's happiness: ""Consider-I address you as a legislator-whether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves respecting their own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness?"" (lines 72-79)
Furthermore, she argues that by denying women civil and political rights, men force women ""to remain immured in their families groping in the dark"" (lines 86-87).
These points suggest that the author believes society's leaders have privileged men over women by granting them freedoms while denying the same to women.

1. Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two agricultural strips - one during the day and one at night.
2. No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
3. The field plowed in daylight had more than 80% of its surface covered by weeds, while only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
The key point is that no crops were planted in Hartmann's experiment to avoid competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops like wheat or corn had been planted, they would have competed with the weeds for resources, likely reducing the percentage of the surface covered by weeds compared to what Hartmann found without any crops.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel.

If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect.

  C: Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals.
  D: Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.
","To determine Grimké's central claim, let's analyze the key points she makes in Passage 2:
1. The Anti-Slavery cause has led her to a better understanding of her own rights as a woman.
2. Human beings have rights because of their shared moral nature, not due to differences like race or sex. 
3. If rights are founded on moral nature, then sex does not give men higher rights than women. To believe otherwise would be to wrongly elevate the physical over the moral.
4. When humans are viewed as moral beings, sex becomes insignificant in determining rights and responsibilities. 
5. Grimké concludes that whatever is morally right for a man to do is also morally right for a woman to do. Duties arise from people's varied circumstances and talents, not from gender.
Considering these points, Grimké's central claim is that an individual's rights are determined by their moral nature as human beings, not by race or sex. This aligns best with choice A.

Choices A, C, and D are mentioned as supporting points but do not capture the main argument of the passage as a whole.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. The author of Passage 2 recognizes that space mining may prove beneficial to humanity, stating that ""we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all"" (lines 50-52). The author also repeatedly mentions that space mining should be carefully considered before it is implemented: ""But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought"" (lines 53-54); ""But [space mining's] consequences - both here on Earth and in space - merit careful consideration"" (lines 57-59).Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 concedes that ""space mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns"" (lines 55-56) but does not imply that space mining will recklessly harm the environment, either on Earth or in space. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 does not address any key resources that may be disappearing on Earth. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 admits that ""resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth"" (lines 74-76) but does not mention any disagreement about the commercial viabilities of space mining discoveries.",B,B,1,1286,223,1509,

","Choices:
  A: brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals.
  B: CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus.
  C: nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed.
  D: conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.
","To determine the correct answer, let's review the relevant information from the passage:
1. Olausson and colleagues discovered that humans have slow-conducting, unmyelinated nerve fibers called C-tactile (CT) fibers, which are sensitive to gentle, slow tactile stimulation.
2. They studied a patient named G.L. who had lost fast-conducting fibers but retained slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers. When her arm was gently brushed, activating the CT fibers, she reported feeling a pleasant sensation.
3. In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated during gentle brushing. However, in G.L., only the insular cortex, which processes emotion, was active.
4. This led to the conclusion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps describe the sensation.
Based on this information, the answer that best fits the question is:
Action: Answer(""B"")
The passage clearly states that CT fibers, when exposed to gentle brushing (a stimulus), convey an emotional aspect of touch.","Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",B,B,1,1406,248,1654,

  A: affection but not genuine love.
  B: objectivity but not complete impartiality.
  C: amusement but not mocking disparagement.
  D: respect but not utter deference.
","Thought process:
Akira addresses Chie in a formal and polite manner, using respectful language like ""Madame"" and apologizing for the disruption. He bows to her and speaks to her deferentially.
However, he is also direct in stating his purpose and standing up for his wishes to marry Naomi, even though he knows it's not proper form. He doesn't grovel or act utterly submissive to Chie.
So while he is respectful, he is not showing complete deference or submission. He treats her with respect while still being forthright about his intentions.
Therefore, the best answer is that Akira addresses Chie with respect but not utter deference.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer because Akira clearly treats Chie with respect, including ""bow[ing]"" (line 26) to her, calling her ""Madame"" (line 31), and looking at her with ""a deferential peek"" (line 34). Akira does not offer Chie utter deference, though, as he asks to marry Naomi after he concedes that he is not following protocol and admits to being a ""disruption"" (line 31).Choice $A$ is incorrect because while Akira conveys respect to Chie, there is no evidence in the passage that he feels affection for her. Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither objectivity nor impartiality accurately describes how Akira addresses Chie.

","To determine what happens in the passage, let's break it down:
1. Akira visits Chie's home unexpectedly on a winter's evening.
2. Akira explains he has an opportunity to go to America as a dentist for Seattle's Japanese community. 
3. However, Akira says that depending on Chie's response, he may stay in Japan. He then asks for Naomi's hand in marriage.
4. This surprises Chie, who had viewed Akira and Naomi as children, not considering Naomi's marriage prospects.
5. Akira leaves, and Chie discusses this with Naomi, expressing shock at his bold request.
6. Naomi reveals she met Akira at a literary meeting and declares she intends to marry him.
The key event is Akira making an unexpected marriage proposal to Chie for her daughter Naomi's hand. This surprises Chie, as she had not considered Naomi's marriage or Akira as a potential suitor.
Therefore, the best description of what happens is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In the passage, a young man (Akir(A)asks a mother (Chie) for permission to marry her daughter (Naomi). The request was certainly surprising to the mother, as can be seen from line 47, which states that prior to Akira's question Chie ""had no idea"" the request was coming.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage depicts two characters engaged in a civil conversation, with Chie being impressed with Akira's ""sincerity"" and finding herself ""starting to like him."" Choice C is incorrect because the passage is focused on the idea of Akira's and Naomi's present lives and possible futures.

  C: impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
  D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans
","To determine which criticism Bryan would most likely make of Beveridge's vision, let's analyze the key points in each passage:
Passage 1 (Beveridge):
- Envisions Americans pouring into and governing Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba
- Believes this will bring justice, safety, order, and prosperity to these islands
- Sees it as America's divine destiny to expand its territory and influence
Passage 2 (Bryan):
- Argues that if the U.S. holds colonies, it must expect the people there to protest and resist
- Invokes the American Revolution and founding fathers who opposed political bondage
- States that God placed the love of liberty in every human heart, and no race would welcome a foreign master
- Warns that repudiating self-government in the Philippines would weaken the principle in the U.S.
Bryan's main argument is that the people of these islands would resist American governance because it goes against the principle of self-determination. He believes no people would welcome foreign rule.
Therefore, of the given choices, Bryan would most likely criticize Beveridge's vision as being:
Action: Answer(""D"")
Naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. Bryan argues throughout Passage 2 that the islanders would resist foreign domination, making Beveridge's assumption that they would welcome American governance appear naive.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines. However, in the first paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan warns, ""If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ... must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",D,D,1,1322,307,1629,

","To determine the best answer, let's review the key findings from Olausson's 1993 experiment:
1. They recorded nerve signals while gently brushing subjects' arms with fingertips.
2. Using microneurography, they measured the speed at which the nerves fired.
3. Soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed.
4. The delayed signal reached the brain about a half second later, traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers (about 1 m/s).
5. In contrast, fast-conducting fibers, already known to respond to touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The passage does not compare the sensing speed at bodily extremities versus closer to the brain. 
B. The presence of hairs is not mentioned as a factor affecting nerve conduction speed in this experiment.
C. The experiment showed that gentle pressure is sensed by both fast fibers (immediate signal) and slow fibers (delayed signal).
D. The experiment did not test the effect of pressure strength on nerve firing speed.
Therefore, the conclusion best supported by the 1993 experiment findings is C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

3. By offering only clover to the control colonies, the authors are implicitly assuming that clover does not have the same protective effect as the pyrethrum-producing plants.
4. In other words, they are assuming that clover does not produce pyrethrums. If clover did produce pyrethrums, there would be no difference between the experimental and control groups.

2. The school has only one room for seven grade levels and 26 students total (lines 59-60), suggesting a small population.
3. The citizens were ""in the mood for a little excitement"" (lines 20-21) at Miss Spivey's arrival, implying not much usually happens there.
4. Miss Spivey's predecessor, Miss Chandler, never used the old world map (lines 68-70), hinting at limited resources and a traditional mindset.
5. Mavis, the only 7th grader, is 13 years old (lines 62-63), indicating that most students don't progress beyond primary school, typical of rural areas at that time.

  B: present research that suggests that the Venus flytrap's predatory behavior is both complex and unique among plants.
  C: identify the process by which the Venus flytrap's closing action has evolved.
  D: provide a brief overview of the Venus flytrap and its predatory behavior.
","To determine the primary purpose of the passage, let's analyze the main points:
1. The passage describes how the Venus flytrap senses prey and closes its trap, focusing on the role of trigger hairs and the energy required for this action.
2. It explains the analogy between the Venus flytrap's sensing mechanism and short-term memory, discussing how the plant encodes, stores, and retrieves information.
3. The passage then presents the research by Hodick and Sievers, who proposed that the Venus flytrap stores information about trigger hair stimulation in the electric charge of its leaf, involving calcium ions.
4. Further research by Volkov and colleagues is mentioned, which supports the model by demonstrating the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing action.
The passage primarily focuses on presenting and explaining the scientific findings that help understand the mechanism behind the Venus flytrap's closing action. While it does provide an overview of the plant's predatory behavior, this serves as context for the main discussion of the research findings.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The first two paragraphs of the passage describe the physical process by which the Venus flytrap closes its trap but also note certain long-standing questions about that process: ""How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?"" The passage then answers those questions by discussing, in the third and fourth paragraphs, a study conducted by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers that identified the physiological means behind the closing of the Venus flytrap's trap and, in the last paragraph, a study conducted by Alexander Volkov that confirmed and built on Hodick and Sievers's findings. The primary purpose of the passage can therefore be seen as discussing scientific findings that explain how the Venus flytrap closes its trap.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss the Venus flytrap's ability to close its trap in the context of the abilities of other plants. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage discusses how the closing action operates but not how it has evolved. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't provide an overview of the Venus flytrap and its predatory behavior; it merely notes in passing that the closing action has a predatory function.",A,A,1,1253,234,1487,

  D: A character's visit to her family's ink shop deepens her appreciation of her family's work.
","To determine the best summary, let's analyze the key points in the passage:
1. The narrator and Old Widow Lau visit the narrator's father's ink shop.
2. The narrator's father and uncles don't initially recognize them but eventually welcome them warmly.
3. The narrator observes her father's interaction with a customer, showcasing the quality and meaning of their family's ink.
4. The narrator recalls her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in ink-making.
5. The narrator listens to her father's words and finds them more important than her aunt's thoughts.
6. The narrator feels proud hearing her father speak highly of their family's ink.
The passage focuses on the narrator's visit to the family ink shop, her observations of her father's interaction with a customer, and her reflections on the importance and quality of their family's ink. The visit deepens her understanding and appreciation of her family's work.
Therefore, the best summary is:
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, ""I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way."" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought.

  C: Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.
  D: Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel.
","To determine Ken Dial's central assumption, let's analyze the relevant information:
1. Ken Dial observed that young ground birds like pheasants and quail would jump up and flap their partially developed wings.
2. He designed a project to study how baby game birds learned to fly, hoping it would provide clues about the ground-up-tree-down debate on the evolution of bird flight.
3. He chose the Chukar Partridge as a model species for his experiments.
4. The key discovery came when Dial realized that the young birds were using their legs and wings cooperatively to climb up inclined surfaces - a behavior he termed wing-assisted incline running (WAIR).
5. Dial suggested that WAIR helps explain the origin of the flapping flight stroke in birds and the aerodynamic function of partially developed wings - addressing critiques of both the tree-down and ground-up hypotheses for the evolution of bird flight.
Dial's central assumption seems to be that studying the development of flight behaviors in young birds can provide insights into how flight evolved in birds' ancestors. By investigating WAIR, he aimed to shed light on the evolutionary transition from ground-dwelling to flying animals.
Therefore, the statement that best captures Ken Dial's central assumption is:
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The author explains that Dial created his initial experiment to try and create ""new data on the age-old groundup-tree-down debate,"" and that he looked for ""clues"" in ""how baby game birds learned to fly"" (lines 8-11).

1. The narrator visits her father's ink shop and observes him interacting with a customer, describing the quality and characteristics of their family's ink.
2. The narrator recalls Precious Auntie's teachings about the importance of effort and thoughtfulness in creating good ink, as opposed to quick and easy modern methods.
3. The father emphasizes the superior quality of their family's ink to the customer, highlighting its color, smoothness, sound, and scent, which justify its high price.
4. The narrator feels proud of her father's words about their family's ink.
The passage focuses on the value of putting deliberate effort into creating a high-quality product, as exemplified by the family's ink-making process. This is contrasted with modern, effortless methods that result in inferior quality.

1. The passage mentions that when bees are immunocompromised or nutritionally deficient, they may be further weakened when commercially produced insecticides are introduced into their hives by beekeepers trying to fight mite infestations.
2. This suggests that the insecticides, while intended to combat mites, can have the unintended consequence of harming the health of bees that are already in a weakened state.

","Let's analyze the last paragraph to determine the main idea:
- Mr. Peters' physical appearance has changed - his hair is graying, he has lost weight, and his color is poor. This suggests he is aging.
- However, he seems unaware of these changes in himself. He still acts in ways that suggest he sees himself as a younger man.
- He straightens his tie self-consciously and gestures with the menu to show off his diamond ring to the women at the next table. These actions imply he wants to impress others and still sees himself as attractive to women.
- The passage states that the ""young man"" (referring to his younger self) has never deserted Mr. Peters and is ""always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.""
This suggests that even though Mr. Peters has aged physically, mentally he still identifies with and behaves like his younger self. He has not fully accepted or adjusted to the fact that he is now a middle-aged man.
Therefore, the main idea that best captures this is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer.

1. The passage contrasts how the gold affected Silas versus how Eppie affects him. The gold kept his thoughts in a repetitive cycle, ""leading to nothing beyond itself"".
2. In contrast, Eppie ""was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit"".
3. Eppie made Silas look forward to ""the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her"".
4. So Eppie has changed Silas' outlook from a narrow, repetitive focus on his gold to anticipating a future of change and new experiences as Eppie grows up.

By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage explains that Silas spends time outdoors after the arrival of Eppie, there is no indication that her presence has necessarily changed his understanding of his place in nature.

- Argues women should conform to this subordinate role and gain influence through peaceful, domestic means
Passage 2:
- Argues that the anti-slavery cause has led the author to better understand her own rights as a woman
- Asserts that human rights are based on moral nature, which is the same for all people regardless of sex
- Claims that what is morally right for men to do is also morally right for women to do
- Argues that duties originate from one's relations in life, talents, and era, not from sex
Passage 2 directly challenges the main argument of Passage 1. While Passage 1 claims women have a subordinate role that they should conform to, Passage 2 argues that men and women have the same fundamental rights based on their shared moral nature. Passage 2 rejects the idea that sex determines one's rights and responsibilities.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer.

B) Neither passage focuses on men working selflessly for political change. Beecher argues men can ""act on society"" through intellect, shame, fear, and force, but doesn't call this selfless. Grimké doesn't address this topic.
C) Beecher argues women's influence is ""not any the less important"" despite their ""subordinate relation in society."" But she doesn't say it's undervalued. Grimké criticizes the idea that ""sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" but doesn't explicitly say women's obligations are undervalued. 
D) The authors disagree here. Beecher says women using ""coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere"" in politics. Grimké says ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do,"" implying political activism is equally important for both.
In summary, only choice A represents a clear point of agreement between the two passages.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society.

In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves.

Passage 1:
- Women are excluded from government and public employments
- This exclusion leads to greater happiness for both sexes
- Women's ""delicate constitutions"", ""peaceful inclinations"", and motherhood make them suited for ""gentle occupations"" and domestic duties, not politics
- The ""division of powers"" between the sexes is natural and should persist
Passage 2: 
- If women aren't educated to be men's companions, it will ""stop the progress of knowledge and virtue""
- Women need to understand their duty and ""real good"" through freedom and reason
- It's unjust for men to ""subjugate women"" and deny them the right to judge their own happiness
- Denying women civil and political rights forces them to ""remain immured in their families groping in the dark""
The authors would likely disagree on women's roles and rights. Passage 1 sees women's exclusion from politics as natural and beneficial, while Passage 2 sees it as unjust and oppressive.
However, they would probably agree that in the 18th century, women generally had fewer rights than men (D). Passage 1 notes women's exclusion ""from any participation in government"", while Passage 2 criticizes the denial of women's ""civil and political rights"".

3. Men can act on society through public debate, physical force, etc. But women are to influence society through ""peace and love"" by making themselves respected, esteemed and loved.
4. Beecher emphasizes that women's influence is ""to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle"" where their intellect, benevolence, and gentle nature will be valued.
5. She concludes that through this, women will have a strong influence on the men in their lives (""fathers, the husbands, and the sons"").
Based on these points, Beecher is arguing that women's influence on public life is indirect, as it occurs through their role in the domestic sphere and family life, rather than through direct participation in politics and public debate like men.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph (lines 22-37), Beecher suggests that women can be ""so much respected, esteemed and loved"" by those around them that men will accede to their wishes: ""then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly ...."" These lines show that Beecher believes women can influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect influence on public life. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because lines 34-37 make it clear that Beecher believes women do have an effect on society, even if it is an indirect effect. Beecher does not indicate that women's effect on public life is ignored because most men are not interested (choice $A$ ), unnecessary because men do not need help governing society (choice C), or merely symbolic because women tend to be idealistic (choice D).",B,B,1,1400,261,1661,

  D: Sempere was a friend of the book's author.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The narrator says ""That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it."" This suggests the book was very important to him.
2. He then says ""I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me.""
3. Finally, he states ""Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.""
4. This directly indicates that reading the book convinced him he wanted to be a writer like Dickens.
Therefore, the best answer is A: reading the book convinced him that he wanted to be a writer.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. The last paragraph makes clear the narrator's enthusiasm for Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, and it can be inferred from the last sentence of this paragraph that this enthusiasm motivated the narrator to aspire to a career as a writer: ""Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss gifts the narrator has received in the past; although the father sometimes gave the narrator money to buy sweets and snacks, these weren't gifts since the narrator made the purchases himself. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because although it is clear from the passage that Sempere was kind and even indulgent to the narrator, there is no suggestion that this treatment was inspired by respect for the narrator.

  B: They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law.
  C: They are sometimes at odds with moral responsibilities.
  D: They have become more advanced and refined throughout history.
","To determine Grimké's point about human rights in Passage 2, let's analyze the relevant parts of the passage:
1. ""Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights.""
- This suggests that human rights are inherent and based on the shared moral nature of all people.
2. ""These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable.""
- This indicates that even if rights are denied or taken away (as in the case of slaves), they still exist and cannot be truly separated from a person's moral nature.
Based on these points, Grimké is arguing that human rights have a moral basis that remains valid and authoritative even when those rights are not recognized or are violated.
This aligns best with choice B: ""They retain their moral authority regardless of whether they are recognized by law.""
The other choices do not accurately reflect Grimké's argument in the passage.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the point that human rights are not fleeting or changeable but things that remain, regardless of the circumstances, because they are tied to humans' moral nature. She emphasizes that human rights exist even if societal laws attempt to contradict or override them, citing slavery as an example: ""These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on his moral being, and is, like it, imperishable"" (lines 61-65).Choices $A$ and $D$ are incorrect because in Passage 2, Grimké makes the point that human rights are inherent and unchanging, not that they are viewed differently in different societies (choice (A)or that they have changed and developed over time (choice D).

  C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.
  D: physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage contrasts Eppie with the gold that Silas used to hoard. While the gold kept Silas's thoughts in a repetitive cycle, Eppie is described as ""an object compacted of changes and hopes"" that forces Silas's thoughts onward.
2. Eppie is full of life and draws Silas away from his weaving, reawakening his senses ""with her fresh life"". She brings him joy and makes him engage with the world around him, like taking walks to pick flowers.
3. As Eppie's mind grows ""into knowledge"", Silas's mind is described as growing ""into memory"". As her life unfolds, his soul, which had been ""long stupefied in a cold narrow prison"", also unfolds and trembles ""gradually into full consciousness"".
4. The narrator states that this influence ""must gather force with every new year"" as Eppie develops and requires Silas to notice and account for more in the world around them.
The key idea seems to be that as Eppie grows and her awareness of the world expands, Silas is also reawakened and increasingly engaged with life. This aligns best with choice B.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. The third paragraph of the passage shows that as Eppie learns more and more, Silas reengages with life: ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness."" As Eppie grows into a world that is new to her, Silas recovers a world he'd largely forgotten. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the narrator portrays Eppie as being curious and eager, not physically vulnerable, and also implies that Silas is becoming ever more emotionally robust, not psychologically fragile. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the only connection the narrator makes regarding Silas's former greed and Eppie's presence in his life is that she has brought an end to his obsessive pursuit of wealth.

5. Throughout the passage, Lymie continues reading the book, but the focus keeps shifting to descriptions of the other people in the restaurant.
Therefore, the primary focus shifts from Lymie's experience reading the book to descriptions of the other people in the restaurant.

","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the key points made by each author:
Tocqueville:
- Believes that democracy brings equality between men and women, but they should not be made alike
- Nature has appointed wide differences between man and woman, giving them distinct roles
- Improvement consists of each sex fulfilling their respective tasks in the best possible manner
- Duties of men and women should be carefully divided for the benefit of society
Mill:
- Believes all things should tend towards just equality instead of dominion of the strongest
- The relationship between men and women was the last to embrace equality
- All occupations should be open to everyone, without favor or discouragement
- Each individual should prove their own capacities through trial, and the world will benefit from people's best faculties
- It is unjust and detrimental to society to arbitrarily limit individuals based on sex or class
Considering these points, the answer that best describes the difference in their views is:
Action: Answer(""A"")
Tocqueville believes an individual's position should be defined in important ways by their sex, emphasizing distinct roles for men and women based on nature. In contrast, Mill believes an individual's abilities should be the determining factor, with all occupations open to everyone regardless of sex or class.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1380,282,1662,

  C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.
  D: The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
","To determine the best answer, let's analyze the relevant information from the passage:
1. Touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that opens calcium channels in the trap, rapidly increasing the calcium ion concentration.
2. The trap requires a high concentration of calcium to close, and a single action potential from one trigger hair being touched doesn't reach this level.
3. A second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
4. The calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, so if the second touch doesn't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
A. The passage doesn't mention the second trigger reversing the charge produced by the first trigger.
B. The passage doesn't discuss the second trigger stabilizing the surge of calcium ions.
C. According to the passage, the first trigger already prompts the calcium channels to open.
D. The passage states that the second trigger is necessary to push the calcium concentration over the threshold required to close the trap. This aligns with the idea that the second trigger supplements the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.
Therefore, the best answer is choice D.

2. Woolf states that the bridge ""is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming."" However, she quickly shifts focus, saying, ""But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts.""
3. From the bridge, Woolf observes the ""procession of the sons of educated men"" going about their daily lives and professions.
Based on this information, the bridge serves as a good vantage point to observe the procession of educated men, which is central to the passage's theme. While the bridge is conducive to dreaming and reflection, Woolf emphasizes that she is there to consider facts and observe the procession.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. Woolf argues that the ""bridge over the River Thames, [has] an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey"" (lines 1-3). The phrase ""make a survey"" means to carefully examine an event or activity. Woolf wants educated women to ""fix [their] eyes upon the procession - the procession of the sons of educated men"" (lines 9-11) walking to work.Choice $A$ is incorrect because while Woolf states the bridge ""is a place to stand on by the hour dreaming,"" she states that she is using the bridge ""to consider the facts"" (lines 6-9). Woolf is not using the bridge for fanciful reflection; she is analyzing ""the procession of the sons of educated men"" (lines 10-11). Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Woolf does not compare the bridge to historic episodes. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Woolf does not suggest that the bridge is a symbol of a male-dominated past, but rather that it serves as a good place to watch men proceed to work.",B,B,1,1332,233,1565,

  C: he has finished the chapter about the Congress.
  D: he is preparing to leave the restaurant.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Lymie is reading a history book about the Congress of Vienna while eating dinner at the Alcazar Restaurant.
2. He is distracted by a loud party of four that enters the restaurant and sits near him. Their voices cause him to skim over two pages without comprehending them.
3. He realizes this and goes back to re-read those pages. He reads about a secret treaty between England, France, and Austria.
4. Before he can finish reading the results of the Congress, which are stated at the bottom of page 67 and top of page 68, he recognizes his father's coat hung next to his chair.
5. At this point, Lymie closes the book and says, ""I didn't think you were coming.""
Therefore, the text directly states that Lymie closes the book because his father has arrived and joined him at the table.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the passage, Lymie closes his book only after ""a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair"" (lines 67-68). It is Lymie's father's arrival that causes him to close the book. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 67-70 of the passage clearly establish that Lymie closes his book because his father has arrived, not that he does so because the party of four is too loud (choice B), because he has finished reading a section of the book (choice $C$ ), or because he is getting ready to leave (choice D).",A,A,1,1415,213,1628,

1. ""Plant physiologists have shown that seeds buried more than about one centimeter below the soil surface do not receive enough light to germinate."" (lines 12-14)
2. ""They concluded that soil disturbance gives weed seeds a 'light break,' and this stimulates their germination."" (lines 28-30)
3. ""Although the light exposures from plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can be enough to induce seed germination."" (lines 37-39)
Based on these statements, exposure to light allows buried seeds to germinate or begin to develop. The passage does not mention light exposure helping seeds absorb nutrients, withstand extreme temperatures, or achieve maximum growth.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The passage summarizes research on the relationship between plowing and weed growth. According to the fourth paragraph, the research of Karl Hartmann suggests that plowing fields during the day leads to weed growth because exposure to even small amounts of light can ""induce seed germination,"" or cause seeds to sprout. Thus, according to the passage, exposure to light allows seeds to begin to develop.Choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the passage indicates that small amounts of light cause seeds to sprout, but it doesn't explicitly assert that light exposure allows seeds to absorb necessary nutrients (choice (B)and doesn't discuss whether light exposure helps seeds achieve maximum growth (choice D).

1. Maguire found that the right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in spatial navigation, was 7 percent larger in taxi drivers compared to normal.
2. The passage states that ""It had long been thought that the adult brain was incapable of spawning new neurons-that while learning caused synapses to rearrange themselves and new links between brain cells to form, the brain's basic anatomical structure was more or less static.""
3. The passage then says, ""Maguire's study suggested the old inherited wisdom was simply not true.""
Based on this information, Maguire's findings are significant because they challenge the previously held belief that the adult brain's structure was largely unchangeable. Her study provided evidence that contradicted this earlier consensus.

  D: tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood to an analysis of the effects of those hardships.
","Let's analyze the passage step by step:
1. The passage begins by discussing the narrator's love for reading and books in general. It mentions how the narrator learned to read before other children and saw books as a ""key with which I could unlock a boundless world"".
2. It then describes the narrator's father's disapproval of books and the narrator's habit of hiding them. 
3. The passage goes on to mention the narrator's favorite bookshop, ""Sempere & Sons"", and how it was a sanctuary for him.
4. Towards the end, the passage focuses on a specific incident where the bookseller Sempere gifts the narrator a copy of ""Great Expectations"" by Charles Dickens. 
5. The narrator becomes enchanted with this book, reading it multiple times and becoming convinced that he wants to learn to write like Dickens.
Considering this progression, the main focus does indeed shift from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to the portrayal of an influential incident - receiving the copy of ""Great Expectations"" from Sempere, which greatly impacts the narrator.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles.

- Water mined from other worlds could become the most desired commodity in space (lines 28-30).
- Water ice could be used for drinking, radiation shielding, and making spacecraft fuel (lines 35-40).
- Companies are interested in iron, silicon, and aluminum for 3D printing spare parts or machinery (lines 41-44).
- Space dirt could be used to make concrete for landing pads, shelters, and roads (lines 44-45).
This suggests that resources valuable in space may be different from those on Earth, but the passage does not state this explicitly.
Passage 2:
- ""The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth."" (lines 73-75)
This statement directly expresses the idea that resources valuable in space may differ from those valuable on Earth.
Therefore, the point that is implicit in Passage 1 and explicit in Passage 2 is:

3. However, when G.L.'s arm was brushed, only the insular cortex (which processes emotion) was active.
4. This difference in brain activation between G.L. and normal subjects was due to G.L.'s lack of fast-conducting nerve fibers, which meant she could only sense the emotional quality of touch through her slow-conducting CT fibers.

","To determine what Bryan considers the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule to be, let's analyze the relevant parts of Passage 2:
1. Bryan argues that if the U.S. tries to govern the Philippines as a colony, the Filipinos will ""protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" This suggests the preference for self-rule is strong.
2. He states that the U.S.'s own history has been an encouragement to the Filipinos and others ""who are denied a voice in their own government."" The U.S. was founded on the principle of self-governance.
3. Bryan invokes the words of American leaders like Patrick Henry, Jefferson, Washington and Lincoln who all advocated for liberty and popular government over political bondage. This frames the preference for self-rule as a fundamental American value.
4. Most tellingly, Bryan states ""it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.""

- Contrast this finding with the common assumption that DNA would only have one chain based on its chemical formula.
- Provide evidence (density and X-ray data) that strongly supports their claim of DNA having two chains.
The X-ray evidence and density information are not used to establish DNA as the carrier of genetic information, present an alternate hypothesis about nucleotide composition, or confirm the relationship between DNA's density and chemical formula.

3. It then explains why they were irritated: ""When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else.""
4. This suggests that the people felt Miss Spivey was minimizing or downplaying the discomfort they were feeling in the Georgia heat by comparing it to the even hotter weather in Timbuktu.
5. Of the given choices, ""resentment"" best captures this feeling of irritation at having their discomfort minimized.

1. Hodick and Sievers proposed that the Venus flytrap requires a high concentration of calcium ions to close, and this is triggered by action potentials from the trigger hairs being touched.
2. Volkov demonstrated that applying an electrical current directly to the trap can cause it to close, without touching the trigger hairs.
3. However, Volkov did not measure the calcium levels in the trap when applying the electrical current.
Considering these points, the most valid criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model is that he did not measure a central element of their model - the calcium ion concentrations.
While Volkov's experiments showed that electrical current can cause the trap to close, he did not directly confirm that this was due to increased calcium levels, which is a key part of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

","To determine how the narrator is portrayed, let's look at key details from the passage:
1. The narrator notices many details about her father's shop, like the polished floors, shiny glass cases, and the artful arrangement of the ink. She says ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy."" This shows she is very observant of her surroundings.
2. She recalls Precious Auntie's teachings about the meaning and purpose behind ink-making. This also demonstrates her attentiveness and ability to apply past lessons to her current situation. 
3. Listening to her father describe the ink, the narrator feels ""very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way."" She is engaged in the moment and emotionally impacted by her father's words.
4. There are no clear indications that the narrator is reserved, overly sympathetic to others, or anxious. The details emphasize her keen awareness and appreciation of the immediate situation.
Therefore, the best answer is B: the narrator is portrayed as someone attuned to her immediate surroundings.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen."" She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family's ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before.

  B: vibrancy and diversity of American culture.
  C: worldwide history of struggles for independence.
  D: idealism that permeates many aspects of American society
","To determine what Beveridge and Bryan both express admiration for, let's look at key points each makes:
Beveridge (Passage 1):
- Praises the noble land and mighty people of America
- Highlights America's ""glorious history"" of liberty, expansion, and growth
- Sees America as having a great destiny to spread its influence
Bryan (Passage 2): 
- References the Founding Fathers like Patrick Henry, Jefferson, and Washington who championed liberty and opposed political bondage
- Cites the principles of the Declaration of Independence 
- Believes in the universal human love of liberty placed in every heart by God
Both passages show a clear reverence for America's founding principles and history, especially related to liberty and self-governance. While they seem to disagree on imperialism, they both ground their arguments in admiration for America's foundations.
Therefore, the answer that best captures what both express admiration for is:
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge expresses admiration for the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society, but Bryan doesn't.",A,A,1,1280,216,1496,

  B: They have the same migration routes as those of ibises.
  C: They create a similar wake to that of ibises.
  D: They expend more energy than do ibises.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that the findings about ibises ""likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese"" (lines 46-47).
2. The findings about ibises were that they position themselves in a V formation to catch the uplifting eddies from the bird in front, and time their wing flaps to optimize this effect (lines 32-36).
3. The author suggests that pelicans, storks, and geese likely do the same thing as ibises because they also have long wings.
4. Having long wings is related to the wake or air currents created by the birds. The passage states that ""Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult"" (lines 49-50).
5. By contrast, the long-winged birds like ibises, pelicans, storks, and geese presumably create simpler wakes that make drafting possible.
Therefore, the implication is that pelicans, storks, and geese create a similar wake to that of ibises, which allows them to fly in a V formation and draft off each other in a similar way.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. At the beginning of the fifth paragraph the passage states that ""the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult."" In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication.

  C: It has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves.
  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","To determine which claim Lincoln would most likely agree with, let's analyze the relevant parts of Passage 2:
1. Lincoln says that differences between states in things like commerce, agriculture, etc. have not caused difficulties or quarrels. In fact, he calls them ""the very cements of this Union.""
2. However, he contrasts this with slavery, saying ""But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it?""
3. Crucially, Lincoln states: ""It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace.""
4. He reinforces this point: ""All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory.""
Based on these statements, Lincoln clearly believes that the controversy over slavery is primarily fueled by attempts to introduce slavery into new regions where it didn't previously exist. He argues that when slavery has been confined to its current boundaries, there has been relative peace on the issue.
Therefore, the claim that Lincoln would most likely agree with is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery.

","Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.""
2. This suggests that the Venus flytrap's multiple trigger requirement serves to ensure that it only closes when the prey is substantial enough to justify the energy expenditure.
3. The passage does not mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey, so choice A is unlikely.
4. While the passage discusses calcium's role in the closing mechanism, it doesn't suggest that the multiple trigger requirement is related to conserving calcium reserves, making choice B unlikely.
5. The passage also doesn't suggest that the multiple trigger requirement prevents premature closure before capturing prey, as the trap only closes after the second trigger, not before. This makes choice D unlikely.
6. The best answer seems to be choice C, as the multiple trigger requirement ensures that the Venus flytrap only expends the significant energy required to close its trap when the prey is large enough to be worth the energy cost.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1234,268,1502,

","To determine the main purpose of the first paragraph, let's analyze it:
Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?
The paragraph questions whether Akira's direct approach, which broke tradition, was the reason for Chie's reaction. It suggests that if Akira had followed the traditional form of using a go-between, Chie might have been more receptive to his proposal.
Thought process:
- The paragraph is not primarily describing a culture, though it mentions a traditional custom. 
- It does not directly criticize the tradition, but rather questions whether following it would have led to a different outcome.
- The paragraph does question a suggestion - specifically, it questions whether Akira's direct approach was the right choice.
- While Chie's reaction is mentioned, the paragraph does not analyze it in depth.
Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question Akira's nontraditional suggestion of approaching Chie directly.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals.

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","Let's analyze the passages to determine the central difference in how Beveridge and Bryan view liberty in the United States:
1. Beveridge sees the U.S. as divinely chosen to spread liberty to other lands through conquest and expansion. He believes the U.S. has a ""noble destiny"" to extend its influence, comparing it to ""a greater England."" 
2. In contrast, Bryan argues that holding colonies like the Philippines goes against American principles of self-government and liberty. He states that conquest ""would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred"" and that the U.S. ""cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here.""
3. Beveridge presents U.S. liberty as so great that it justifies imperial expansion to spread it to other peoples. But Bryan warns that this very expansion would undermine the exemplary quality of American liberty and self-rule.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer(""B"")
Beveridge considers U.S. liberty so exemplary as to justify conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",B,B,1,1379,251,1630,
