","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately reflect the central tension between the two passages.

The correct answer is choice C: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position. In Passage 1, Douglas accuses Lincoln of violating the law of God by criticizing the Constitution, which allows for the existence of slavery. In Passage 2, Lincoln responds by arguing that Douglas misinterprets his position and that he is not attacking the Constitution, but rather the idea that the Union cannot stand because of the presence of slavery.

Therefore, the central tension between the two passages is the disagreement between Douglas and Lincoln over the interpretation of the Constitution and its relationship to slavery.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",,C,0,1397,216,1613,

The passage highlights the importance of educated women joining the procession of educated men, but it also acknowledges the challenges they face in doing so. The author notes that educated women have always had to think ""from hand to mouth"" and have had to find ways to think and act despite the limitations placed on them. The passage also emphasizes the need for educated women to take an active role in shaping the institutions of English society, rather than simply accepting their existing power structures.

Therefore, the central claim of the passage is that the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects, and that educated women must play a more active role in challenging and transforming these institutions.

The central claim of the passage is choice C, ""the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects.""","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

Choices:

A: part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that the correct choice is (A) part of a broad social shift toward greater equality. Both authors are advocating for the equality of men and women, and they believe that this change is necessary to create a more just and equitable society. They argue that the natural differences between men and women do not justify the existing inequalities, and that improving the position of women is essential for the betterment of society as a whole. Therefore, option (A) best captures their shared view.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general. This can be seen in the first paragraph of Passage 1, where Tocqueville explains that raising woman to be ""more and more the equal of man"" is part of the overall ""social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant,"" and in the first paragraph of Passage 2, where Mill writes that ""mankind have outgrown"" the state of inequality and ""now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality,"" with gender roles being the last of these relations to undergo such a shift.Choice B is incorrect because although in Passage 1 Tocqueville argues that there are costs to treating men and women the same, in Passage 2 Mill characterizes gender equality as a source of benefits only. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither author considers changing gender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead on questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people's potential.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B: It could raise the value of some precious metals on Earth. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is option D: It could change scientists' understanding of space resources.

The passage highlights the potential for space mining to yield materials that are not found on Earth, such as water ice from the moon's poles, which could be used for drinking or as a radiation shield. The author also notes that the resources mined from asteroids could be used in space-based projects, such as fueling spacecraft. This suggests that space mining could expand our understanding of the resources available in space and their potential uses.

In contrast, options A, B, and C do not accurately reflect the information provided in the passage. Option A is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the materials being important to Earth's economy. Option B is also not supported, as the passage does not mention any precious metals being raised in value on Earth.

Reflection:
I previously answered choice (A) The corrupting influence of a materialistic society as the best description of a major theme in the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not accurate. The passage does not suggest that Eppie's materialism is a major theme. Instead, the passage highlights the contrast between Eppie's energetic and curious nature and Silas's enfeebled spirit. Eppie's influence on Silas is a major theme in the passage, as she brings new life and joy to his existence.

Therefore, the best description of a major theme in the passage is choice (C) The bittersweet brevity of childhood naïveté. The passage shows how Eppie's innocence and curiosity bring new life to Silas's spirit, but also how she will eventually grow up and lose her innocence. This theme is evident in the passage's description of Eppie's mischievous behavior and Silas's struggle to balance his love for her with his need to teach her about the world.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $D$ is the best answer.

A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

Reflection:

Initial answer: B

Reasoning:

In Passage 2, the author argues that the exclusion of women from political rights and functions is a political phenomenon that is inexplicable on abstract principles. The author contends that women's exclusion is not only unjust but also harmful to society as a whole, as it denies them the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and to contribute to the common good. The author suggests that women's exclusion is based on a flawed understanding of their role in society, which is rooted in gender-based discrimination and inequality.

To support their argument, the author invokes the principles of reason and justice, arguing that women have the same right to participate in government as men do. The author also challenges the notion that women are inherently inferior to men, suggesting that this belief is a product of social and cultural conditioning rather than any inherent difference in their abilities or capacities.

In conclusion, the author argues that the exclusion of women from political rights and functions is a violation of their basic rights and is detrimental to society as a whole. The author's argument is based on the principles of reason, justice, and equality, and challenges the prevailing views on gender roles and social hierarchy.

Initial answer: I initially answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice A, ""lower than the percentage that Hartmann found."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in a higher percentage of the surface covered with weeds, as these crops would compete with the weeds for resources and space.

Correct answer: Based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is choice B, ""higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted."" Hartmann's experiment showed that plowing at night resulted in a lower percentage of the surface covered with weeds compared to plowing during the day. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of the surface covered with weeds would likely have been higher than Hartmann's original prediction, as these crops would have competed with the weeds for resources and space.","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B

Reasoning:
After reading Passage 2, I initially believed that Grimké's central claim was that men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish. Grimké argues that when human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. This suggests that Grimké believes that men and women should have equal opportunities to achieve their full potential.

However, upon further reflection, I realized that Grimké's central claim is actually C: Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals. Grimké argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that these rights are not determined by race or gender. This suggests that Grimké believes that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals, and that these rights should be respected regardless of an individual's race or gender.

Conclusion:
My initial answer was incorrect, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the passage and correct my mistake. Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals, and that these rights should be respected regardless of an individual's race or gender.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66).

I previously answered choice (D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.

Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch.

Initial Answer: B

Explanation:
At first, I thought Akira's tone was respectful, but not utterly deferential. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Akira's tone was more like C - amusement but not mocking disparagement. Akira's use of formal language and sincerity in his speech suggests that he has a genuine interest in Naomi, and his blushing and eagerness to make his point further reinforce this interpretation. While Chie may have found his proposal amusing, there is no indication in the passage that she mocked or disparaged Akira's intentions. Therefore, the best answer is (C) amusement but not mocking disparagement.","Choice D is the best answer because Akira clearly treats Chie with respect, including ""bow[ing]"" (line 26) to her, calling her ""Madame"" (line 31), and looking at her with ""a deferential peek"" (line 34). Akira does not offer Chie utter deference, though, as he asks to marry Naomi after he concedes that he is not following protocol and admits to being a ""disruption"" (line 31).Choice $A$ is incorrect because while Akira conveys respect to Chie, there is no evidence in the passage that he feels affection for her. Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither objectivity nor impartiality accurately describes how Akira addresses Chie.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (D) naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Passage 2 suggests that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance for being impractical, rather than naive.

The passage states that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans living in the present to resist foreign domination. This implies that the Filipinos are capable of organizing themselves and defending their rights, rather than being passive recipients of American governance. Additionally, the passage notes that the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources, which suggests that they are not willing to accept a subordinate role in the eyes of the American government.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (C) impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.

Answer: (C) Impractical.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines. However, in the first paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan warns, ""If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ... must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",,D,0,1458,209,1667,

Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that the acquisition of flight in young birds can provide insights into the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. He observed that young birds in the wild prefer to rest on elevated perches, such as ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches, where they are safe from predators. However, in his controlled research setting, he found that young birds were using their legs to climb up hay bales instead of flying up to perches. This observation led him to conclude that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, which is the central assumption of his research.

After re-reading the two passages, I realized that Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1. The author of Passage 1 argues that women should have the same rights as men because they are moral beings, and their rights are founded on their moral nature. However, the author of Passage 2 disagrees with this argument, stating that the relationship between men and women is not based on their moral nature, but on their different roles in society.

Therefore, the best answer is (B) Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.

Answer: (B) Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not ""exert coercive influences"" that would put her ""out of her appropriate sphere"" (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 . Choice $C$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society.

After re-reading the passages and analyzing the authors' arguments, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. Both authors agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities, and that these duties are not limited by their sex. They argue that women have the same moral nature as men and are entitled to the same rights and responsibilities. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Women have moral duties and responsibilities.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

I previously answered question 60 incorrectly, selecting choice B as the best reason why the narrator considers Great Expectations to be the best gift he ever received. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is choice C, the gift meant that Sempere held him in high regard.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that Sempere's gift of Great Expectations was significant because it showed that he held the narrator in high regard. The narrator notes that Sempere ""gave me the best gift I have ever received"" and that ""from now on, he's your friend too."" This language suggests that the gift was more than just a book, but a symbol of Sempere's approval and appreciation for the narrator.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, the gift meant that Sempere held him in high regard.

Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't discuss gifts the narrator has received in the past; although the father sometimes gave the narrator money to buy sweets and snacks, these weren't gifts since the narrator made the purchases himself. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because although it is clear from the passage that Sempere was kind and even indulgent to the narrator, there is no suggestion that this treatment was inspired by respect for the narrator.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option C: divine gift to the American people. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually supports option B: replication of conditions in Europe.

In Passage 1, Beveridge argues that the United States has the resources and immensity to feed and clothe the world, and that its coastlines enclose half the countries of Europe. He also states that the United States is set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe. These statements suggest that the United States is similar to Europe in terms of its size and geographical location, and that it has the potential to replicate the conditions found in Europe.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: replication of conditions in Europe.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (A) Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the passage.

In the passage, Tocqueville and Mill present different views on the proper position of individuals in society. Tocqueville argues that society should be organized in such a way that each individual can exercise their faculties in the largest and highest sphere possible, without being limited by their sex or any other arbitrary classification. Mill, on the other hand, suggests that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being hindered by societal expectations or gender roles.

Based on this analysis, the best answer is choice (C) Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position. This is because Tocqueville emphasizes the importance of allowing individuals to exercise their faculties in the most appropriate way, while Mill focuses on the individual's own desires and interests in determining their position.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",C,A,0,1528,305,1833,

I previously answered question 45 incorrectly, selecting option A: The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer does not align with the information provided in the passage. The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close, and that this is due to the fact that the first trigger does not reach a high enough concentration of calcium ions to close the trap on its own. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.

Answer:

According to the passage, the correct answer is option C: The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open. This is explained in the passage as follows: ""They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" This suggests that the second trigger hair is necessary to reach the required concentration of calcium ions in the trap, allowing it to close.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant. The fourth paragraph further explains that the calcium concentration produced by this initial touch isn't enough to cause the trap to close, but that a second hair touch will bring the total concentration to the level necessary to close the trap: ""a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.""Choices A and B are incorrect because the fourth paragraph explains that the second trigger supplements the action of the first trigger, not that it reverses it (choice (A)or stabilizes its effect (choice B).

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option A, which states that the passage chooses the setting of the bridge because it is conducive to a mood of fanciful reflection. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage actually chooses the setting of the bridge because it is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men.

The passage describes the bridge as a ""caravanserai crossing a desert,"" which suggests a sense of passage and transition. The author suggests that the procession of the sons of educated men is a long-standing tradition that has been occurring for centuries, and that they are now at a crossroads, deciding whether to join this procession or not. The bridge serves as a symbol of this legacy, representing the passage of time and the accumulation of knowledge and experience.

Furthermore, the author notes that the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking ""from hand to mouth,"" suggesting that they have been actively engaged in shaping their own destinies. The bridge serves as a symbol of this active engagement, representing the idea that the procession of the sons of educated men is not a fixed or predetermined path, but rather a choice that requires active participation and engagement.

In conclusion, the passage chooses the setting of the bridge because it is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men, and represents the idea that this procession is a choice that requires active participation and engagement.","Choice B is the best answer.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the data provided in the table do not necessarily support this claim. While it is true that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, this does not necessarily mean that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

The table only provides information on the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen, and does not provide information on the severity of the infection or the timing of the infection. It is possible that the colonies with colony collapse disorder were already weakened by other factors, such as nutritional deficiencies or pesticide exposure, which made them more susceptible to infection with varroa mites.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.""

Initial Answer: B

Reasoning:
I initially chose option B because the passage mentions the X-ray evidence and density, which suggests that the authors are using these properties to support their claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not provide enough information to support this conclusion. The passage only mentions the X-ray evidence and density in the context of establishing the structure of DNA, and does not provide any direct evidence for the number of chains in a molecule of DNA. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

[REDACTED]

Justification:
The passage provides information about the X-ray evidence and density of DNA, which are used to establish the structure of DNA. The authors do not provide any direct evidence for the number of chains in a molecule of DNA using these properties.

  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
","  Reflection:

Initial Answer: I incorrectly answered B, Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

Reasoning: Based on the passage, Volkov's experiment seemed to contradict the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers. According to the passage, Volkov applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, which made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs. This seemed to suggest that the electrical charge alone was sufficient to cause the trap to close, which conflicted with Hodick and Sievers's model that the trap requires a specific threshold of calcium ions to close.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that my initial interpretation was incorrect. The passage does not explicitly state that Volkov's experiment disproved Hodick and Sievers's model. Instead, it suggests that Volkov's experiment provided additional evidence supporting the model proposed by Hodick and Sievers. The passage states that Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close, as long as fourteen microcoulombs flowed between the two electrodes. This is consistent with Hodick and Sievers's model that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, which can be induced by an electrical action potential.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.

Answer: A, Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers's model was incorrect.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate whether the technology Volkov used had been available to Hodick and Sievers when they formulated their model.",,B,0,1426,351,1777,

Throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings. The passage highlights her observations of the ink shop, including the dark wood floors, shiny glass cases, and the different types of inksticks. The narrator takes note of the details of her surroundings, such as the lighting, the smells, and the sounds.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option A: founding and history of the United States. However, upon further reflection, I realize that both passages actually focus more on the idealism and principles of American society, rather than its founding or history. Passage 1 emphasizes the idea of America as a ""noble land"" with a ""divinely logical"" history of expansion and the spread of liberty, while Passage 2 highlights the importance of respecting the rights and aspirations of colonized peoples.

Passage 2 suggests that the controversy over slavery has been exacerbated by attempts to introduce it to regions where it is not practiced, rather than by differences in religion and social values between states. Lincoln's argument is that the spread of slavery has been the source of conflict, rather than the natural variations between states. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B).

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery.

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question as follows:

""I believe the significant advantage of the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers is that it enables the plant to identify the species of its prey. The plant can use the multiple triggers to differentiate between different types of insects, ensuring that it only captures the larger and more nutritious ones. This would conserve the plant's energy and resources, as it would only invest in capturing prey that is worth its while.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that the Venus flytrap uses the multiple triggers to identify the species of its prey. Instead, it highlights the importance of the multiple triggers in ensuring that the plant only closes its trap when it is sure that the insect is large enough to be worth its time.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

The Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers helps to prevent it from wasting energy and resources on small or insignificant prey. By requiring multiple triggers, the plant can ensure that it only closes its trap when it is confident that the insect is large enough to be worth its time and effort. This helps to conserve the plant's energy and resources, as it would not need to waste them on small or insignificant prey.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",,C,0,1383,315,1698,
