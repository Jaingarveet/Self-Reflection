Statement A is not necessarily true, as it refers to Canadian films shown at international festivals, whereas the original statement refers to films generally.

Statement B is incorrect as it refers to Canadian films produced and not specifically those shown at the festival.

Statement C is the correct answer as it is the only statement that logically follows from the original statements. The original statements tell us that most films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international festivals, and that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, it must be true that some of the films that won prizes at international festivals were Canadian films.

Statement D is not necessarily true as it is possible that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international festival, we just know that most films did so.

Statement E is not necessarily true as it is possible that all films that won prizes at international festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.

","Thought: 
The principle illustrated in the argument is that of 'clean hands doctrine'. This legal principle states that someone cannot benefit from or use as evidence any information obtained through illegal means, even if it is for a just cause.

In each of the choices, a situation is described where one party has committed a wrongdoing, and another party responds with a similar or related wrongdoing. The correct answer will illustrate a situation where the response is not justifiable due to the nature of how the information was obtained or the method used.

Choice A: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because Long's response to Price's theft is a separate wrongdoing, and there is no mention of how Long obtained the information.

Choice B: This scenario comes closest to illustrating the clean hands doctrine. Shakila's knowledge of her secretary's wrongdoing is based on her own past experience, which could be considered an illegal means of obtaining information.

Choice C: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because Sarah's parents could have obtained the information about her sneaking out from Takashi regardless of his curfew violation. The curfew violation does not impact the justifiability of their potential punishment for Sarah.

Choice D: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because the conservation officer's discovery of Kuttner's illegal traps is not inherently tied to the officer's trespass. The officer's trespass may be a separate ethical or legal issue, but it does not invalidate the discovery of Kuttner's wrongdoing.

Choice E: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine. While the board of directors may have pardoned similar improprieties in the past, this does not change the fact that Ramirez's actions were improper. The principle in the argument is focused on the means of obtaining evidence, not the consistency of punishment.

","Thought: 
The correct answer choice will weaken the physician's argument that magnetic fields are effective in relieving back pain.

Answer choice A is the correct answer as it introduces an alternative explanation for the results of the experiment. It suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to the placebo effect, which is a powerful phenomenon where a patient's belief or expectation of treatment leads to an improvement in their condition, regardless of whether the treatment is actually effective. This alternative explanation undermines the conclusion that magnetic fields are solely responsible for the pain relief.

The argument given is a form of fallacy known as ""Denying the Antecedent."" This fallacy involves stating that if A leads to B, then the absence of B means the absence of A. In the squirrel/bird feeder scenario, the absence of a protective cover (B) leads to the presence of squirrels (A), so the argument claims that the absence of squirrels must mean the presence of a protective cover. However, this is flawed reasoning as there could be other factors at play.

Choice A presents a similar fallacy. It states that if low tire pressure (A) leads to premature wear (B), then the absence of premature wear (not B) means the tire pressure is not low (not A). This is the same logical structure as the original argument and is therefore the correct answer.

  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are
","Thought: 
The argument is that stray cocker spaniels found near Flynn Heights likely belong to residents of that neighborhood because more cocker spaniels are registered there than anywhere else.
To evaluate this argument, it would be useful to know if the high number of registered cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights is due to unique characteristics of the neighborhood or its residents.

Choice A addresses dog behavior, which is not relevant to the argument.
Choice B is irrelevant; the argument already states that more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights.
Choice C discusses the number of stray dogs found, but this does not provide insight into why one breed dominates registrations in a particular area.
Choice D considers pet ownership rates, but this does not directly relate to the argument's focus on a specific breed.

Choice E is the most useful as it considers whether the licensing behavior of Flynn Heights residents could be a factor in the high number of registered cocker spaniels. If residents of Flynn Heights are more diligent in licensing their dogs, it could explain the high number of cocker spaniel registrations without requiring that there are more of this breed in the neighborhood.

The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has a right to develop its own natural resources, even if this may impact wildlife, as other nations have already done so. They argue that any environmental impact may not be as severe as in other countries, and that the economic benefits outweigh the potential harm.

Of the given choices, the principle that most strongly supports this position is ""C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.""

This principle suggests that regulation is not necessary unless there is clear evidence of harm to endangered species populations. It implies that development can proceed in the absence of such evidence, which aligns with the Development Commission's argument that Figorian wetland development ""might not affect wildlife.""

While the other choices touch on important environmental and regulatory considerations, they do not directly support the Development Commission's argument in the same way as choice ""C.""

Choice ""A"" suggests international regulation, which goes against the Development Commission's emphasis on Figoria's sovereignty. Choice ""B"" prioritizes wildlife preservation over economic needs, conflicting with the Development Commission's argument for development. Choice ""D"" takes a strict approach to environmental regulation, not allowing for considerations of varying degrees of harm across nations. Choice ""E"" expresses a general sentiment against resource depletion but does not address the specific argument about the potential for varying impacts on wildlife.

Therefore, choice ""C"" is the strongest support for the Figorian Development Commission's position.

The argument concludes that Pluto is not a true planet, despite having an atmosphere and being larger than asteroids. The key premise is that Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune, not the sun, and was later ejected.

Choice A is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not discuss moons.
Choice B is a definition of a ""true planet"" that would include Pluto, going against the argument's conclusion.
Choice C is interesting but irrelevant to the argument's conclusion, as it discusses Pluto's hypothetical position if it had not been ejected.
Choice D is also irrelevant, as the argument does not hinge on the size of celestial bodies.
Choice E is the assumption that underlies the argument's conclusion: true planets must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively, which Pluto did not.

Choice C is incorrect because the argument does not discuss the effects on fish of different sizes; it only mentions small fish. 
Choice E is incorrect because the argument does concerned with above-normal amounts of algae, not below-normal, and does not discuss the effects on small fish in general.

  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
","Thought: 
The science journalist's statements support the inference that the presence or absence of lithium in the atmosphere of a celestial object is indicative of the object's mass and the functionality of its nuclear furnace.

Choice A is incorrect because not all celestial objects without lithium in their atmospheres are stars with less mass than the Sun. Some may be brown dwarfs or other objects with different formation histories.

Choice B is incorrect because not all celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres have incompletely mixed elements. Stars more massive than the Sun also have lithium but their elements are thoroughly mixed due to higher temperatures and pressures.

Choice C is incorrect because it is a negative statement that is too broad. While it is true that the presence of lithium suggests an object is not a brown dwarf, the absence of lithium could be due to other factors besides being a brown dwarf.

Choice D is incorrect because it is a negative statement that is too broad and misleading. There may be celestial objects with lithium that have less mass than the Sun, but they are not brown dwarfs because they have functional nuclear furnaces that can consume lithium.

Choice E is correct because it is the most specific and accurate inference based on the information provided. Brown dwarfs are defined by their mass range and the fact that they do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces that can consume lithium. Therefore, if a celestial object has lithium in its atmosphere, it cannot be less massive than a brown dwarf, as it would then fall into the category of a planet or smaller substellar object.
