Passage 1 suggests that women are naturally inclined towards peaceful occupations and the cares of the home due to their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and the duties of motherhood. It does not suggest that these roles are rewarding for men, yield less value for society, or require skills similar to those needed to run a country or a business. It also does not suggest that these roles entail very few activities that are difficult or unpleasant. 
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 state that women should seek ""gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" so they can avoid performing difficult, or ""strenuous,"" and unpleasant, or ""onerous,"" tasks.Choices A, B, and D are retry because the authors of Passage 1 do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require professional or political skills.",D,C,0,1272,98,1370,

The table shows the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together. The percentage for all four pathogens is not explicitly given in the table. However, the lowest percentage given for any single pathogen in colonies with colony collapse disorder is 77% (for Nosema apis). Therefore, it is impossible for 100% of colonies to be infected by all four pathogens. The answer must be less than 77%.

The passage starts with Ken Dial observing a pattern in young birds. He then designs an experiment to study this pattern further. During the experiment, an unexpected finding arises when the birds use their legs instead of flying. This leads to a modification in the study, and the results are interpreted and evaluated, leading to the proposal of the wing-assisted incline running (WAIR) technique. 
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing how baby Chukars learn to fly. During the experiment, Dial noticed the unusual way Chukars use their ""'wings and legs cooperatively'"" to scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created ""a series of ingenious experiments"" (line 46) to study this observation. After his additional experiments, Dial determined that these baby birds angle ""their wings differently from birds in flight"" (lines 49-50).Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ are retry because they do not accurately reflect the sequence of events in the passage.",D,D,1,1243,87,1330,

The narrator is observant and attentive to her surroundings. She tries to notice everything so she can later tell GaoLing what she had seen. She also listens carefully to what her father is saying. This suggests that she is attuned to her immediate surroundings.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is retry because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is retry because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is retry because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",B,A,0,1207,62,1269,

","Thought: 
The passage does not provide any direct information about how the presence of crops like wheat or corn would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds. However, it does mention that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops had been planted, they might have competed with the weeds, potentially affecting the percentage of the surface covered with weeds. However, it's not clear whether this would have made the percentage higher or lower than Hartmann's findings. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that it would have been nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is retry. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is retry because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",C,A,0,1469,134,1603,

The first paragraph introduces Akira's unexpected visit to Chie's house, breaking the traditional way of proposing marriage. It also raises a question about whether Chie would have been more receptive if Akira had followed the traditional approach. Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to analyze a reaction.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is retry because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is retry because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals.
