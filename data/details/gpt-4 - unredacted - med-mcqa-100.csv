Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness.

","Choices:
  A: Oligohydramnios
  B: Placenta pre
  C: Pelvic tumor
  D: Uterine anomalies
","Thought: 
An unstable lie refers to a situation where the baby's position in the womb changes frequently. This can be due to several reasons. Oligohydramnios (A) refers to a condition where there is too little amniotic fluid, which could potentially cause an unstable lie. Placenta previa (B) is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix, which can also cause the baby to change positions frequently. A pelvic tumor (C) could potentially cause an unstable lie by physically obstructing the baby's position. Uterine anomalies (D) could also potentially cause an unstable lie by altering the shape or structure of the uterus. However, given the patient's history of 2 normal deliveries, it is less likely that she has a significant uterine anomaly. Therefore, the most likely cause of the unstable lie in this case is placenta previa (B).
Action: Answer(""B"")","Placenta pre can be associated with several other conditions, including malpresentation, unstable lie, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and intrauterine growth restriction. There may also be an increased risk of congenital anomalies; however, there is no association with any specific anomaly. Ref: Wagner S.A. (2013). Chapter 18. Third-Trimester Vaginal Bleeding. In A.H.
