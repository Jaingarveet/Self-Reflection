## Analysis of Current Question:
The key takeaway from my previous error is to focus on the **direct implications** of the given statements and avoid assumptions or extrapolations. 
Here's what we know for sure:
* **Only Canadian films are shown at Lac Nichoutec.**
* **Most prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won prizes internationally.**
We need to find a statement that **must be true** based on these facts. Let's analyze the options:
* **A:** This assumes all prize-winning Canadian films internationally were at Lac Nichoutec, which is not stated.
* **B:** This assumes Lac Nichoutec showcases most Canadian films produced, which is not stated.
* **C:** This directly follows from the given information. If Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally, then some international winners must be Canadian.
* **D:** This is possible but not guaranteed. We only know about ""most"" winners, not all.
* **E:** This is also possible but not guaranteed. The information focuses on Lac Nichoutec winners, not all international winners.
Therefore, the only statement that **must be true** is that some internationally awarded films were Canadian, as they were also winners at Lac Nichoutec.

## Analysis of Current Question:
The radio producer's argument follows a pattern of:
1. **Dilemma:** Two options are presented (classical music only vs. diversifying genres).
2. **Negative consequence of one option:** Sticking to classical music risks going out of business.
3. **Conclusion:** Therefore, diversify genres to avoid the negative consequence.
We need to find an option with a similar structure.
## Evaluating Choices:
* **A:** This focuses on cost comparison, not avoiding a negative consequence.
* **B:** This focuses on time constraints and practicality, not avoiding a negative consequence.
* **C:** This focuses on achieving a desired outcome (privacy), not avoiding a negative consequence.
* **D:** This focuses on resource limitations and practicality, not avoiding a negative consequence.
* **E:** This presents a dilemma (blinds vs. curtains) and a negative consequence of one option (bare windows) leading to a conclusion (make valances if not curtains). This structure closely mirrors the radio producer's argument.
