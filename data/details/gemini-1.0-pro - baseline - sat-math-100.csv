The line passes through the origin, so the equation of the line is of the form $y = mx$.
We can find the slope of the line using the two given points: $m = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$.
Since the line passes through the origin, we know that $y = 0$ when $x = 0$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $0 = m \cdot 0$, which means that $m = 0$.
Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = 0$.
The only value of $k$ that satisfies this equation is $k = 0$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$.

An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is p dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars.

The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$.

We can see that when $x$ increases by $2a$, $y$ decreases by $a$. This means that the slope of the line is $-\frac{1}{2}$.
We can also see that when $x=0$, $y=0$. This means that the y-intercept of the line is $0$.
Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

The slope represents the rate of change of the dependent variable ($y$) with respect to the independent variable ($x$).

","Thought:
First, we need to factor the numerator of the fraction on the left-hand side of the equation. We can do this by recognizing that the numerator is in the form of a difference of squares: $x^2 - 1 = (x+1)(x-1)$.
Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by $(x-1)$, but only if $x \neq 1$. This gives us:
$$x+1 = -2$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = -3$$
However, we need to remember that we divided by $(x-1)$, so $x = 1$ is not a valid solution.
Therefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = -3$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is correct. Factoring the numerator of the rational expression $\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}$ yields $\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}$. The expression $\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x-1}$ can be rewritten as $\left(\frac{x+1}{1}\right)\left(\frac{x-1}{x-1}\right)$. Since $\frac{x-1}{x-1}=1$, when $x$ is not equal to 1 , it follows that $\left(\frac{x+1}{1}\right)\left(\frac{x-1}{x-1}\right)=\left(\frac{x+1}{1}\right)(1)$ or $x+1$. Therefore, the given equation is equivalent to $x+1=-2$. Subtracting 1 from both sides of $x+1=-2$ yields $x=-3$. Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. Substituting 0,1 , or -1 , respectively, for $x$ in the given equation yields a false statement. Substituting 0 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\frac{0^{2}-1}{0-1}=-2$ or $1=-2$, which is false.

Expanding the left side of the equation gives $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$.
Equating the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ on both sides gives $ab=15$ and $7a+2b=c$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ to get $a=3$ and $b=5$.
Substituting these values into $7a+2b=c$ gives $c=31$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

The shipping charge increases by $4.95 for every 5 pounds increase in merchandise weight.
This means the slope of the linear relationship is $4.95/5=0.99$.

This means the y-intercept of the linear relationship is $16.94$.
The equation of the linear relationship is $f(x)=0.99 x+16.94$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice B is correct. Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches.

To find the equivalent temperature increase in degrees Fahrenheit for a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius, we can solve the equation for $F$ and get $F=\frac{9}{5}C+32$.

The population decreases by 10% every 20 years, which means it retains 90% of its population every 20 years.
This can be modeled by a factor of 0.9 raised to the power of the number of 20-year periods that have passed.
The number of 20-year periods that have passed is $t/20$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9. Since the engineer estimates that the population will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years, the present population, 50,000, must be multiplied by $(0.9)^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of 20 -year periods that will have elapsed $t$ years from now. After $t$ years, the number of 20 -year periods that have elapsed is $\frac{t}{20}$.

After the alterations, the length is $1.1l$ and the width is $(1-p/100)w$.
The new area of the rectangle is $1.1l(1-p/100)w$.
The area decreased by 12%, so we have the equation:

The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$.
