The commission on each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.
The sales person needs to make a salary of at least $1000.
To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person needs to make $1000/$25 = 40 sales.

","Thought:
The question asks for the length of the space shuttle, not the product of the number of letters in the city and state names.
To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to use the information given about its maximum speed and the time it takes to pass a point.
The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds, so its maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5m/s.
It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the length of the space shuttle is its maximum speed multiplied by the time it takes to pass a point, which is 17.5m/s \* 5s = 87.5m.

","Thought:
The youngest member of the club is 7 years old, and the ages of the members are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
Let's assume there are n members in the club.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula:
Sum = (n/2) \* (first term + last term)
We know the first term is 7 years, and we can express the last term as (7 + (n-1) \* (1/4)).
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
250 = (n/2) \* (7 + 7 + (n-1) \* (1/4))
Simplifying and solving for n, we find that there are 20 members in the club.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Let, n be the number of members in the club.Then,
250 =(n x [2×7+(n+1)×3/12]) / 2.

","Thought:
The question asks for the length of line segment RU, where U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of SU is half the length of ST.
The length of ST is given as 22, so the length of SU is 22/2 = 11.
Since RS is a line segment, the length of RU is the sum of the lengths of RS and SU.
The length of RS is given as 5, so the length of RU is 5 + 11 = 16.
However, none of the answer choices match this value.
I must have made a mistake in my calculations.
Let me double-check my work.

Thought (after double-checking):
I made an error in my calculation of the length of RU.
The length of RU is not the sum of the lengths of RS and SU, but rather the difference between the lengths of RT and SU.
The length of RT is given as 17, so the length of RU is 17 - 11 = 6.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Since SR + RT = 22 = ST, then R is somewhere between S and T.
Since ST is 22, then SU is 11 because U is the midpoint of ST.
Since SR < SU, then R is somewhere between S and U.

  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","Thought:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. We can also infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins.

The passage states that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid competition with emerging weeds. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips, the crops would have competed with the weeds for resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight, which would likely have reduced the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",A,A,1,1872,86,1958,

","Choices:

","Thought:
Expanding the given equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a b=15$ and $7 a+2 b=c$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation for $a b$, we get $a(8-a)=15$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 . Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41 .Choice $A$ is incorrect; the numbers 3 and 5 are possible values for $a$ and $b$, but not possible values for $c$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; if $a=5$ and $b=3$, then 6 and 35 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(5 x+2)(3 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+35 x+6 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 6 and 35, the value of $c$ is 41 and not 6 and 35. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect; if $a=3$ and $b=5$, then 10 and 21 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(3 x+2)(5 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+21 x+10 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 10 and 21 , the value of $c$ is 31 and not 10 and 21 .",D,D,1,866,170,1036,

The process of digestion involves both physical and chemical changes.

Chemical changes involve a change in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.

The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.
