Choice A: This choice suggests that the local herders are becoming more aware of the need to protect the salamanders, but it doesn't necessarily contradict the expert's theory. The herders could still be inadvertently harming the salamanders.
Choice B: This choice suggests that changes in the environment, specifically the water source, could be affecting the salamanders. This could potentially contradict the expert's theory, but it doesn't directly address the issue of trampling.
Choice C: This choice directly contradicts the expert's theory. If the salamanders hide under rocks during the day, they would be less likely to be trampled by cattle and sheep.
