  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
","Thought:
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The length of the space diagonal can be calculated using the formula:
d = sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2)
where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the rectangular solid, respectively.

Action:
Calculate the length of the space diagonal using the given dimensions of the rectangular solid:
d = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2)
d = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225)
d = sqrt(250)
d ≈ 15.8113

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is approximately 15.8113.

Answer(""B"")","In an inscribed rectangle in a sphere, we will have a line joining the opposite vertices as the diameter.
According to the Pythagoras theorem, sides 3, 4 give diagonal as 5 ==> with 5 and 15, we get 5sqrt(10).
5sqrt(10) or 15.8113 is the diameter of the sphere.

First, let's find out how much work Mr. Brown and Mr. Black have completed before Mr. Blue starts working.

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days, he can paint 8/6 = 1.33 houses.
Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days, he can paint 6/8 = 0.75 houses.

Together, they have painted 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses.

Since they have already painted more than 2 houses, Mr. Blue only needs to paint the remaining 0.92 (3 - 2.08) of a house.

Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so it will take him 0.92 \* 12 = 11.04 days to paint the remaining portion.

However, since Mr. Blue cannot work for a fraction of a day, he will need to work for a full 12 days to complete the remaining portion of the house.

Amy can use single letters to code for some of the books and pairs of letters to code for the rest.
If she uses single letters, she can code for up to 26 books (assuming she uses all the letters of the alphabet).
However, since she only has 10 types of books, she can use single letters for some and pairs of letters for the rest.
If she uses only single letters, she can code for at most 4 books (since the smallest number of letters she can use is 4).
To code for the remaining 6 types of books, she can use pairs of letters.
Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, she can use the combination formula to calculate the number of ways she can choose 2 letters from 4: C(4,2) = 4! / (2!(4-2)!) = 6
Therefore, she can code for all 10 types of books using only 4 letters.
Action: Answer(""B"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

","Thought:
Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys.
Since both of them made 35 toys in total, we have:
x + y = 35

Since both of them worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that the time taken by both of them is the same.
Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours.
Then, Jacob worked for t hours as well.

We know that Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy.
So, we have:
7x = 9y

Now, we have two equations and two variables.
We can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination method.

Using substitution method, we can substitute y from the first equation into the second equation:
7x = 9(35 - x)
7x = 315 - 9x
16x = 315
x = 19.6875

Since the number of toys made by Alex must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 20.

Then, we can substitute x = 20 into the first equation to find y:
20 + y = 35
y = 15

Therefore, Jacob made 15 toys.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

  D: 8(√3 – 2)
  E: None of these
","Thought:
Let's denote the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower as ""d"" and the height of the tower as ""h"".
We can use trigonometry to relate the angles of elevation to the distances and height.
When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have tan(45°) = h/d, which simplifies to h = d.
When the angle of elevation is 60°, we have tan(60°) = h/(d - vt), where v is the speed of the car and t is the time it takes for the angle to change from 45° to 60°.
We know that t = 10 minutes and tan(60°) = √3.
Substituting these values, we get √3 = h/(d - 10v).
Since h = d, we can substitute this into the equation to get √3 = d/(d - 10v).
Solving for v, we get v = d/(10 + √3).
Now we want to find the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance to the base of the tower, which is d - 10v.
We can use the formula time = distance/speed to find this time.
Substituting the values we have, we get time = (d - 10v)/v = (d - 10d/(10 + √3))/(d/(10 + √3)) = (d(10 + √3) - 10d)/(d) = √3.
Therefore, it will take √3 \* 10 = 10√3 minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.
None of the given choices match this answer, so we must select ""E: None of these"".
Action: Answer(""E"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

","Thought:
Let's denote the monthly sale as x.
The servant's monthly income is equal to his salary plus his commission on the monthly sale.
The commission is 15% of the monthly sale, which can be written as 0.15x.
The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000, so we can set up the following equation:
1500 + 0.15x = 6000

To solve for x, we can first subtract 1500 from both sides of the equation:
0.15x = 4500

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.15:
x = 30000

Action: Answer(""A"")","Servant’s commission amount

The question states that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so 90% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored.
Then, 90% of the rest (which means 90% of the 90% vanilla flavored chocolates) are squashed.
So, we need to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed.

Calculation:
90% of 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or 81%

This means that 81% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and squashed.
Since we want to find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates that are not squashed, we subtract 81% from the total percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates (90%).

Calculation:
90% - 81% = 9%

","Thought:
Let's denote the number of matches played by Sachin as x.
The formula for calculating the batting average is:
Batting average = Total runs scored / Number of matches played

Initially, Sachin's batting average is 51, so we have:
51 = Total runs scored / x

After scoring 78 runs in the finals, his batting average becomes 54, so we have:
54 = (Total runs scored + 78) / (x + 1)

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x.

From the first equation, we have:
Total runs scored = 51x

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
54 = (51x + 78) / (x + 1)

Multiplying both sides by (x + 1), we get:
54(x + 1) = 51x + 78

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
54x + 54 = 51x + 78

The total number of smaller cubes in the hollow cube is (5^3) - (3^3) = 125 - 27 = 98.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are a total of 98 \* 6 = 588 faces.
The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, and each face has 25 smaller cubes, so there are a total of 6 \* 25 = 150 smaller cubes on the outer surface.
Each smaller cube on the outer surface has one face painted, so there are a total of 150 painted faces.
Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 588 - 150 = 438.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

First, let's find out how much zinc and copper are in alloy X and alloy Y.
Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9, so in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (6/15) \* 40 = 16 grams of zinc and (9/15) \* 40 = 24 grams of copper.
Alloy Y has zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11, so in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18) \* 60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18) \* 60 = 36.67 grams of copper.

Now, let's find out how much zinc and copper are in alloy Z, which is made by melting and mixing 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y.
Alloy Z has 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams of zinc and 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams of copper.

The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 39.33 : 60.67, which simplifies to 59 : 91.

First, we need to find the number of revolutions in 30 seconds. Since the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds (which is half a minute), it will make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is 2π(10) = 20π centimeters.

Ball A takes 26/2 = 13 minutes to make one full rotation.
Ball B takes 35/5 = 7 minutes to make one full rotation.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes.

Action: Answer(""A"") (since 1 hour and 31 minutes is equal to 91 minutes)","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7

","Thought:
Let's denote the distance between A and B as ""d"".

First, we know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to cover the remaining 70 miles to reach B. Therefore, the total time he spent driving from A to B was 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours.

The time it took him to drive from A to B is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:

d / 70 = 4

Solving for d, we get:

d = 70 \* 4 = 280 miles

Since he drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to drive back is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:

280 / 90 = 3.11 hours (rounded to two decimal places)

The total time he spent driving is equal to the time it took him to drive from A to B plus the time it took him to drive back to A:

4 hours + 3.11 hours = 7.11 hours

However, we know that the total time he spent driving was 3 hours less than twice the time it took him to drive from A to B:

Now, let's analyze the left side of the equation:
ABCDE1 is equal to 10000 \* A + 1000 \* B + 100 \* C + 10 \* D + E + 1.

Comparing both sides, we can see that:

","Thought:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.

To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:

Sum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2

where Sum is the sum of the ages (250), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).

We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:

n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)

Substituting the given values:

n = (250 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)

We can simplify and solve for n:

n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)

n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)

n = 500 / (13 + n/4)

4n = 2000 / (13 + n/4)

4n(13 + n/4) = 2000

52n + n^2 = 2000

n^2 + 52n - 2000 = 0

","Thought:
Let's use ratios to solve this problem.
First, we know that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 rolls.
Therefore, the ratio of pita breads to rolls is 6:2 or simplified to 3:1.
Next, we know that 3 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
Therefore, the ratio of rolls to baguettes is 3:5.
Since we want to compare pita breads to baguettes, we need to find a common factor between rolls and pita breads.
We can multiply the first ratio by 3 and the second ratio by 1 to get the same number of rolls:
(3:1) x 3 = 9:3
(3:5) x 1 = 3:5
Now we can compare pita breads to baguettes:
9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 3 rolls, and 3 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
Therefore, 9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
To find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes, we can set up a proportion:
9/5 = x/2
Cross-multiplying, we get:
5x = 18
x = 18/5 = 3.6
Since we cannot have a fraction of a pita bread, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.

The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so they will arrive at the station at the same time every 10 minutes.
The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M., which means that the harbor line train will arrive 2 minutes after the main line train.
Since the frequency is 10 minutes, the man will have to wait for either 2 minutes or 8 minutes for the next train.
The probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time between the arrival of two consecutive trains.
The probability of catching the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2, and the probability of catching the harbor line train is 8/10 = 0.8.
The total probability of catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of catching either train, which is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.

","Thought:
A regular pentagon has 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) and its center (F).
To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points out of these 6.
However, we cannot choose all 4 points from the vertices as it would form a pentagon.
So, we have two cases:
1. Choose 3 vertices and the center (F)
2. Choose 2 vertices, the center (F), and one of the remaining vertices.

For case 1, we have 5 choose 3 ways to select the vertices, which is 10 ways.
For case 2, we have 5 choose 2 ways to select the first two vertices, which is 10 ways. Then, we have 3 remaining vertices to choose from, so we have 3 ways to select the last vertex. Therefore, we have 10 * 3 = 30 ways for case 2.

However, we have overcounted the quadrilaterals that include the center and two adjacent vertices, which would form a triangle instead of a quadrilateral. There are 5 such cases, one for each vertex.

So, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 30 (case 2) - 5 (overcounted) = 35.

But none of the choices match this answer. There must be a mistake in the calculation.

Let's reconsider case 2. We have 5 choose 2 ways to select the first two vertices, which is 10 ways. But we don't have 3 ways to select the last vertex. Instead, we have 2 ways to select one of the remaining non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, we have 10 * 2 = 20 ways for case 2.

So, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 20 (case 2) - 5 (overcounted) = 25.

But none of the choices match this answer either. There must be another mistake in the calculation.

Let's reconsider the overcounting. We only overcount the quadrilaterals that include the center and two adjacent vertices. But in case 2, we are not choosing two adjacent vertices, so there is no overcounting.

So, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 20 (case 2) = 30.

To find the number of grams of the health food needed to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to find the least common multiple of the reciprocals of the percentages given.

For vitamin E, we have 9%, which is equivalent to 0.09. The reciprocal of 0.09 is approximately 11.11.
For vitamin A, we have 8%, which is equivalent to 0.08. The reciprocal of 0.08 is approximately 12.5.

The least common multiple of 11.11 and 12.5 is 137.5. However, since we cannot eat a fraction of a gram, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 138.

However, none of the given choices match this answer. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Since we need to meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, we need to find the number of grams that will provide at least 100% of each vitamin.

For vitamin E, we need to find the number of grams that will provide at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement. Since one gram provides 9%, we need to find the number of grams that will provide 100/9 = 11.11 grams. However, since we cannot eat a fraction of a gram, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 grams.

For vitamin A, we need to find the number of grams that will provide at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement. Since one gram provides 8%, we need to find the number of grams that will provide 100/8 = 12.5 grams. However, since we cannot eat a fraction of a gram, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 grams.

The speed of the elevator is constant, so the time it takes to travel a certain distance is proportional to the distance.
Let's call the distance between each stop ""d"" steps, and the time it takes to travel between stops ""t"" minutes.

20d = 10t
10d = 20t

We can simplify the first equation to get d = t/2, and substitute this into the second equation to get t = 20.

First, let's calculate the total distance of the journey. Since the train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, the total distance is 100 \* 10 = 1000 miles.

Next, let's calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance. Since the first quarter of the distance is 1000/4 = 250 miles, and the train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, it takes 250/100 = 2.5 hours to cover the first quarter of the distance.

After covering the first quarter of the distance, the train slows down to a speed of 75 miles/hour. The remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. At a speed of 75 miles/hour, it takes 750/75 = 10 hours to cover the remaining distance.

Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours.

The cost of newspapers on Monday is $1 \* x = $x.
Since the hotel buys the same number of newspapers every day except Sunday, the cost of newspapers from Tuesday to Saturday is $5x.

",Error: 'choices',"Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
