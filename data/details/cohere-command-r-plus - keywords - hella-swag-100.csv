","Thought: 
The correct answer is likely to be related to the idea of gaining perspective and writing about the relationship from a different viewpoint, as this is the main theme of the text.

Choice A is incorrect because it suggests framing the relationship in a way that sets it apart from others, which is not mentioned in the text.

Choice B is correct because it advises writing the story in the third person, which provides a different perspective and distance from the relationship, helping to gain perspective.

Choice C is incorrect because it does not mention changing the narrative perspective or gaining a new view of the relationship.

Choice D is incorrect because it focuses on including facts and details, not on changing the perspective or narrative style.
