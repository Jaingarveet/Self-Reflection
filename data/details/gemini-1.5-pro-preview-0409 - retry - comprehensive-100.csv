If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?
Choices:
  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24

  A: 13x/2
  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Thought:
Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair, so the total width per section is 0.5 (picket) + 6 (space) = 6.5 inches.
Since there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces between them.
Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is 0.5x (pickets) + 6.5(x-1) (spaces).
Simplifying, we get 0.5x + 6.5x - 6.5 = 7x - 6.5 inches.
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12: (7x - 6.5)/12. 
This is not in the choices, so we need to find an equivalent expression.
Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate the decimal gives (14x - 13)/24.
Action: Answer(""E"") 
","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12
Simplify to get (13X-12)/24

","Choices:
  A: $(-5,-2)$
  B: $(3,-8)$
  C: $(4,-6)$
  D: $(9,-6)$
","Thought:
We can solve this system of equations using elimination.
Let's multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\-3 x+6 y=-57\end{array}$$Now, add the two equations together to eliminate x:
$$10y = -80$$Divide both sides by 10 to solve for y:
$$y = -8$$Substitute y = -8 into the first equation to solve for x:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (3, -8).
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are retry because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",B,B,1,383,187,570,
