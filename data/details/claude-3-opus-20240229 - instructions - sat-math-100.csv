Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step using the instructions from the reflection:
1. The base number is 9 and the exponent is $\frac{3}{4}$.
2. The exponent is a fraction, so we rewrite the expression:
   $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt[4]{9})^3 = (9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$
3. Simplify the inner expression $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$:
   $9^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{9} = \sqrt{3}$
   
   This is because $\sqrt[4]{9} = 9^{\frac{1}{4}} = (3^2)^{\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{\frac{2}{4}} = 3^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{3}$
4. Now, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of 3 (the numerator of the original exponent):
   $(\sqrt{3})^3 = \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{3}$
5. The resulting expression $3\sqrt{3}$ cannot be simplified further.
6. Looking at the answer choices, the expression $3\sqrt{3}$ matches choice D.
Therefore, the answer is D: $3\sqrt{3}$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Since 9 can be rewritten as $3^{2}, 9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $3^{2^{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}}$. Applying the properties of exponents, this can be written as $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$, which can further be rewritten as $3^{\frac{2}{2}}\left(3^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, an expression that is equivalent to $3 \sqrt{3}$.Choices $A$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$. Choice $C$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$.",D,D,1,541,363,904,

","Choices:
  A: $2^{12}$
  B: 4
  C: $8^{2}$
  D: The value cannot be determined from the information given.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question asks for the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ given that $3x - y = 12$.
2. Simplify $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$:
   $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^{y}} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^{y}} = 2^{3x-y}$
   
3. Notice that the exponent $3x-y$ matches the left side of the given equation $3x - y = 12$.
4. Substituting the value from the equation:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
5. Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is $2^{12}$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. One approach is to express $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ so that the numerator and denominator are expressed with the same base. Since 2 and 8 are both powers of 2 , substituting $2^{3}$ for 8 in the numerator of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ gives $\frac{\left(2^{3}\right)^{x}}{2^{y}}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$. Since the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$ have a common base, this expression can be rewritten as $2^{3 x-y}$. It is given that $3 x-y=12$, so one can substitute 12 for the exponent, $3 x-y$, given that the expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is equal to $2^{12}$. Choice B is incorrect. The expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$, or $2^{3 x-y}$. If the value of $2^{3 x-y}$ is $4^{4}$, which can be rewritten as 28 , then $2^{3 x-y}=2^{8}$, which results in $3 x-y=8$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. If the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is $8^{2}$, then $2^{3 x-y}=8^{2}$, which results in $3 x-y=6$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be determined.",A,A,1,479,247,726,

His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$
  B: $\frac{25}{4} m=5$
  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Key information:
   - Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week
   - His car averages 25 miles per gallon
   - Gasoline costs $4 per gallon
   - Alan wants to reduce his weekly gas expenditure by $5
   - We need to find how many fewer miles (m) he should drive
2. The unknown variable is m, representing the number of miles Alan should reduce his driving by each week.
3. Let's set up the equation:
   - Currently, Alan drives 100 miles, and 100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons used per week
   - So his current weekly cost is 4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16
   - If he reduces his driving by m miles, he'll use (100 - m) ÷ 25 gallons
   - The cost will be ((100 - m) ÷ 25) × $4
   - We want this new cost to be $5 less than the current cost of $16
4. Equation: ((100 - m) ÷ 25) × $4 = $16 - $5
5. Simplify: (4 - (4m ÷ 100)) × $4 = $11
            16 - (16m ÷ 100) = $11
            16 - (16m ÷ 100) = 11
            16m ÷ 100 = 5
            16m = 500
            m = 500 ÷ 16 = 31.25 miles
6. Therefore, Alan needs to reduce his driving by about 31.25 miles per week to save $5.
7. Looking at the choices, (4/25)m = 5 matches our simplified equation of 16m ÷ 100 = 5.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Since gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, and since Alan's car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon, the expression $\frac{4}{25}$ gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car.Multiplying $\frac{4}{25}$ by $m$ gives the cost for Alan to drive $m$ miles in his car. Alan wants to reduce his weekly spending by $\$ 5$, so setting $\frac{4}{25} m$ equal to 5 gives the number of miles, $m$, by which he must reduce his driving.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect. Choices $A$ and $B$ transpose the numerator and the denominator in the fraction. The fraction $\frac{25}{4}$ would result in the unit miles per dollar, but the question requires a unit of dollars per mile. Choices $A$ and $C$ set the expression equal to 95 instead of 5, a mistake that may result from a misconception that Alan wants to reduce his driving by 5 miles each week; instead, the question says he wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\$ 5$.",D,D,1,588,468,1056,
