Explanation:
The authors of Passage 1 believe that women are suited for domestic duties and childrearing, and that this is their natural role. They argue that women have ""delicate constitutions,"" ""peaceful inclinations,"" and are suited for ""gentle occupations"" and ""the cares of the home."" They also suggest that this role is distinct from the roles performed by men, and that it is not appropriate for women to aspire to political rights and functions.

Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it most closely aligns with the authors' views. They do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for men as well as for women (option A), or that these roles yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men (option B). While the authors do suggest that women are suited for domestic duties, they do not imply that these duties are easy or without difficulty (option C).

","  Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. ""Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing,"" says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. ""We didn't think this was possible,"" Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. ""Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down."" 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 ""From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough,"" says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. ""Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before.""Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams.""It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn,"" says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, ""birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots.""

The table shows that 100% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by at least one of the four pathogens (Viruses, IAPV, KBV, and Fungi).

Furthermore, the table shows that 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by Nosema apis, and 100% were infected by either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae (since 100% - 77% = 23%).

Therefore, the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens is:

The passage states that fast fibers were believed to be responsible for transmitting information about location and pressure, and that blocking fast fibers would eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. However, it does not suggest that blocking fast fibers would result in the body compensating by using slow fibers to sense pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The body would compensate by using slow fibers to sense pressure.

It's important to note that the passage does not mention anything about the body compensating for the lack of fast fibers by using slow fibers. In fact, the passage states that slow fibers are responsible for transmitting information about gentle touch, which is a different sensation than pressure. Therefore, option C is not supported by the information in the passage.

Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four down the middle. The decoration was art moderne, except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other 15 page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears. While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed 20 on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of 25 Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and 30 determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and 35 began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and 40 Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France. A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie. 45 The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against 50 the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp 55 cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. 60 Otherwise, he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress 65 were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, ""I didn't think you 70 were coming.""

Mr. Peters' hair was turning gray and his 75 scalp showed through on top. He had lost weight also; he no longer filled out his clothes the way he used to. His color was poor, and the flower had disappeared from his buttonhole. In its place was an American Legion button. 80 Apparently, he himself was not aware that there had been any change. He straightened his tie self-consciously and when Irma handed him a menu, he gestured with it so that the two women at the next table would notice the diamond ring on the fourth 85 finger of his right hand. Both of these things, and also the fact that his hands showed signs of the manicurist, one can blame on the young man who had his picture taken with a derby hat on the back of his head, and also sitting with a girl in the curve of 90 the moon. The young man had never for one second deserted Mr. Peters. He was always there, tugging at Mr. Peters' elbow, making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five.

In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have a subordinate relationship to men in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. He states that women are designed to gain influence and exercise power differently than men, specifically through ""the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles"" and by making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved.

","  Action: Answer(""A"")

The central claim of the passage is that educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions. The author argues that women have previously participated in thinking and decision-making from hand to mouth, and now they have the opportunity to think more deeply about their role in society. The passage emphasizes that women must decide whether to join the procession of educated men and participate in the institutions and professions dominated by men. Therefore, option A is the best answer.

The other options do not accurately reflect the central claim of the passage. Option B suggests that women can have positions of influence in English society only if they give up some of their traditional roles, but the passage does not mention this. Option C states that the male monopoly on power in English society has had grave and continuing effects, but the passage does not focus on this idea. Option D suggests that the entry of educated women into positions of power traditionally held by men will transform those positions, but the passage does not make this claim.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A: educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. Throughout the passage, Woolf advocates for more women to engage with existing institutions by joining the workforce: ""We too can leave the house, can mount those steps [to an office], pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice ...""

Woolf tells educated women that they are at a ""moment of transition"" (line 51) where they must consider their future role in the workforce.Choice B is incorrect because even though Woolf mentions women's traditional roles (lines 68-69: ""while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle""), she does not suggest that women will have to give up these traditional roles to gain positions of influence. Choice C is incorrect because though Woolf wonders how ""the procession of the sons of educated men"" impacts women's roles, she does not argue that this male-dominated society has had grave and continuing effects.

The author suggests that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, if each state carries out the principles upon which their institutions were founded, such as the right of each state to do as it pleases without meddling with its neighbors.

Explanation:
The question is asking for evidence to support the idea that the base pairing in DNA is complementary, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.

The table shows the percentage of each base in various organisms' DNA, including sea urchin DNA.

To find evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, we need to look for a pair of bases that have a high percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA.

The highest percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA is between adenine and thymine, with 17.3% and 17.7% respectively. This suggests that adenine and thymine are paired together in sea urchin DNA, which supports the idea of complementary base pairing.

Therefore, the answer is C: 17.3% and 17.7%.

Previous answer: D
Error keywords: ""earnestness"" and ""immaturity""

Explanation:
Akira's fear of being judged immature is a recurring theme in the passage. He is aware that his unconventional proposal may be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful, and he takes steps to mitigate this by emphasizing his sincerity and respect for Chie and Naomi. However, he also fears that Chie may mistake his eagerness and enthusiasm for immaturity, which could lead her to dismiss his proposal outright.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.

Advice:
When faced with a question about a character's fears or motivations, it's essential to consider their personality traits, actions, and the context in which they find themselves. In this case, Akira's fear of being seen as immature is a vital aspect of his character and his proposal, and it plays a significant role in his interactions with Chie and Naomi.

The passage states that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe, and that the birds carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. It does not provide any information about the ibises' familiarity with migration routes or data loggers, nor does it mention any specific similarity between the ibises' body design and that of modern airplanes.

Answer: 

Explanation:
The passage suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. The fMRIs showed that regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be working in overdrive for the mental athletes. Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. This suggests that the mental athletes were using different parts of their brains to memorize information, which is not normally used in routine memorization. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.

Error Keywords:

* Abstract symbols (B): The passage does not mention anything about mental athletes converting information they are trying to memorize into abstract symbols.
* Numerical lists (C): The passage does not mention anything about mental athletes organizing information into numerical lists prior to memorization.
* Regular brain exercise (D): The passage does not mention anything about mental athletes exercising their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges.

Solution:
The correct answer is choice A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

Instructions:
Read the passage carefully and pay attention to the information provided about the study conducted by Eleanor Maguire and her team. Note the differences in brain activity between the mental athletes and the control subjects, and consider what this might suggest about how the mental athletes are successful at memorization.

  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
According to Hodick and Sievers' model, the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.

In choice B, a large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably. This means that the calcium ion concentration in the trap has decreased over time, and it may not be high enough to close the trap even if a second hair is touched. Therefore, the Venus flytrap will not close around the insect in this scenario.

The other choices do not describe scenarios in which the Venus flytrap will not close around an insect. In choice A, the large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold, which means the trap will close. In choice C, the large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap, which is a necessary step for the trap to close. In choice D, the large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair, which is within the time frame required for the trap to close.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",B,B,1,1834,357,2191,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the theme of the passage.
The passage highlights the transformative impact of parental love on Silas' life, specifically how Eppie's presence awakens him from his monotonous routine and helps him reconnect with the world around him.
The correct answer is (D) The restorative power of parental love.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom."" But after adopting Eppie, Silas became more interested in life outside his job: ""Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life."" A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

The author of Passage 2, Mary Wollstonecraft, argues that women are excluded from political rights and functions, and that this exclusion is unjust and inconsistent with the principles of reason and happiness. She claims that men have usurped the throne of reason and tyrannize over women, denying them civil and political rights and forcing them to remain immured in their families. Therefore, the author's claim is that the freedom granted by society's leaders has privileged one gender over the other, which is choice A: privileged one gender over the other.

The other answer choices do not align with the author's claim. Choice B, resulted in a general reduction in individual virtue, is not supported by the passage. Choice C, caused arguments about the nature of happiness, is also not supported by the passage. Choice D, ensured equality for all people, is opposite to the author's claim, as she argues that women are excluded from political rights and functions.

The central claim of Passage 2 is that space mining has positive potential but its effects should be thoughtfully considered before it becomes a reality, which aligns with choice B. The author argues that it is in everyone's long-term interest to seek a broad agreement on the for-profit exploitation of space, indicating that careful consideration is necessary to ensure that the potential benefits of space mining are realized while minimizing its negative impacts. Therefore, option B is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. The author of Passage 2 recognizes that space mining may prove beneficial to humanity, stating that ""we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all"" (lines 50-52). The author also repeatedly mentions that space mining should be carefully considered before it is implemented: ""But before the miners start firing up their rockets, we should pause for thought"" (lines 53-54); ""But [space mining's] consequences - both here on Earth and in space - merit careful consideration"" (lines 57-59).Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 concedes that ""space mining seems to sidestep most environmental concerns"" (lines 55-56) but does not imply that space mining will recklessly harm the environment, either on Earth or in space. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the author of Passage 2 does not address any key resources that may be disappearing on Earth.

The passage states that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing. This suggests that the activation of CT fibers is responsible for the emotional aspect of touch that humans experience. Therefore, option B: CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, is the correct answer.

It's important to note that the other answer choices are not supported by the information in the passage. Option A: brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals, is not related to the emotional aspect of touch. Option C: nerve fibers that sense pain are suppressed, is also not related to the emotional aspect of touch. Option D: conscious aspects of sensation are ignored, is not supported by the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus.","Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",B,B,1,1813,197,2010,

In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",D,D,1,1645,272,1917,

  C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.
  D: The speed at which a nerve fires is dependent on the strength of pressure applied to the nerve.
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The 1993 experiment conducted by Olausson and his colleagues showed that gentle pressure on the arm prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay in the signal identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers. This means that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers, which supports conclusion C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

The other choices are not supported by the findings of the experiment:

A: The experiment did not test the speed of sensation at bodily extremities versus stimulation closer to the brain.

B: The presence of hairs in human skin did not affect the speed of nerve conduction.

D: The experiment did not test the relationship between the strength of pressure applied to the nerve and the speed at which the nerve fires.

Therefore, the best conclusion supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is conclusion C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. According to the passage, different types of nerve fibers carry signals at different speeds, either fast or slow. The second paragraph outlines a study led by Håkan Olausson in 1993 that measured the response time of nerves when exposed to gentle pressure. Olausson and his team found that ""soft stroking prompted two different signals"" in test subjects' nerve fibers, ""one immediate and one delayed."" Therefore, the conclusion that is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because according to the passage, Olausson's 1993 study didn't compare how signal speed was affected by stimulation in different bodily areas (choice (A)or by different amounts of pressure applied to the nerve (choice D).

","  Action: Answer(""D"")

The correct answer is D: A character's visit to her family's ink shop deepens her appreciation of her family's work.

The passage describes the protagonist's visit to her family's ink shop, where she learns about the quality and craftsmanship of their ink products and witnesses her father's passion for his work. The visit deepens her appreciation of her family's work and helps her understand her father's ambitions. The passage does not focus primarily on the protagonist's relationship with her aunt or the happy reunion between the protagonist and her family members, although these elements are mentioned. Therefore, choice D best summarizes the passage.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality. This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, ""I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way."" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator's surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph.

Explanation:
The passage highlights the importance of quality and deliberate effort in the production of inksticks. The author's father and uncles are described as taking great care in the creation of their inksticks, and the author is proud to hear her father speak of their family's ink in a way that emphasizes its high quality. The passage also mentions Precious Auntie's teachings that good ink cannot be quick or easy to produce, and that the process of pushing an inkstick along an inkstone is a way of cleansing one's mind and heart. These elements suggest that a main theme of the passage is the importance of deliberate effort and quality in creative endeavors. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Error Keywords:

Solution:
The correct answer is B: quality is achieved through deliberate effort.

Instructions:

Advice:
Pay attention to the details in the passage that highlight the importance of quality and deliberate effort in the production of inksticks. Consider how these elements contribute to the overall theme of the passage.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator recounts her Precious Auntie's belief that ""you can never be an artist if your work comes without effort."" Her Precious Auntie states that when the physical act of writing is done with an ""inkstick along an inkstone,"" this process requires an artist to ""take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?"" In the following paragraphs, the narrator recalls the pride she felt while listening to her father describe the high quality of the ink that her family had worked hard to produce. Therefore, a main theme of the passage is that quality is achieved through deliberate effort. Choice A is incorrect. Although family relationships form a backdrop to the passage, the nurturing of these relationships isn't a main theme. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. Although the passage does emphasize that hard work produces higher quality writing than that which is produced through minimal work, the passage doesn't mention that hard work results in material compensation.

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters behaves as if he is a younger version of himself. The paragraph describes how he straightens his tie self-consciously, gestures with his menu to show off his diamond ring, and allows a young man to influence his behavior. These actions suggest that Mr. Peters is trying to present himself as still young and powerful, rather than accepting the natural decline that comes with aging. Therefore, option B is the best answer choice.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In the last paragraph of the passage, Mr. Peters is described as being unaware ""that there had been any change"" in his appearance since he was younger (lines 80-81). Later in the paragraph, the passage states that ""the young man"" Mr. Peters once was ""had never for one second deserted"" him (lines 90-91). The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of himself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself.Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication that he generally does not spend time with his family. Choice $C$ is incorrect because although there are brief mentions of a diamond ring and manicured fingers, the paragraph focuses on Mr. Peters's overall appearance, not on his awareness of status symbols.

Reflection:
I have carefully read the passage and understood the context. I have identified the correct answer choice based on the information provided in the passage. I have provided my answer in the correct format, ""Action: Answer(D)"" I have reflected on my answer and ensured it is accurate. I have double-checked my answer by re-reading the passage and considering other answer choices.

I have chosen option D, ""looks forward to a different kind of future"" as the correct answer. This is because the passage suggests that Silas' adoption of Eppie has led him to look forward to the future with anticipation, eager to see what Eppie will learn and do next. This is a change from his previous obsession with his gold and his narrow focus on his own thoughts.

I have eliminated option A, ""has renounced all desire for money"" because the passage does not suggest that Silas has renounced his desire for money completely. Instead, it suggests that he has a new perspective on life and is no longer trapped in his obsession with gold.

I have eliminated option B, ""better understands his place in nature"" because while the passage suggests that Silas is now more aware of the world around him, it does not explicitly state that he has a better understanding of his place in nature.

I have eliminated option C, ""seems more accepting of help from others"" because while the passage suggests that Silas is now more open to the idea of help from others, it does not explicitly state that he is more accepting of help.

Therefore, I am confident that option D, ""looks forward to a different kind of future"" is the correct answer.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator indicates that with the arrival of Eppie, Silas's thoughts turn from his work and his gold toward Eppie's future and his life with her: ""Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit - carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years."" By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage explains that Silas spends time outdoors after the arrival of Eppie, there is no indication that her presence has necessarily changed his understanding of his place in nature.

Explanation:
Passage 1 presents a view on the role of women in society, arguing that women should conform to a subordinate position and exert influence through peaceful and benevolent means. Passage 2, written by Grimké, takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1, arguing that women have equal rights and responsibilities as moral beings. Grimké's argument directly challenges the idea that women should be subordinate to men, and instead advocates for their equal status and opportunities. Therefore, option B is the best answer, as Grimké's response contradicts the view presented in Passage 1.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not ""exert coercive influences"" that would put her ""out of her appropriate sphere"" (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 . Choice $C$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society.

This is evident in Grimké's argument that women have the same moral nature as men and therefore have the same rights and responsibilities. She also emphasizes the importance of women's duties and influence in society, which are often overlooked.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

Explanation:
The authors of both passages would most likely agree with statement D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.

In Passage 1, the author argues that women are excluded from public employments and political rights, and that this exclusion is justified because it leads to a greater sum of mutual happiness for both sexes. The author also suggests that women are not suited for strenuous habits and onerous duties and are instead summoned to gentle occupations and the cares of the home.

In Passage 2, the author argues that women need education to become the companion of man and to understand their duty and the true principle of patriotism. The author also suggests that the education and situation of women shut them out from investigations into the moral and civil interest of mankind.

Both passages suggest that women in the eighteenth century had fewer rights and opportunities than men, and that this was seen as a natural and just state of affairs. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The authors of Passage 1 admit that women are ""excluded by the other half [men] from any participation in government"" (lines 1-2), and Wollstonecraft states that society's male leaders create laws that deny women ""civil and political rights"" (line 86).Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the authors of both passages would not agree that women had the same preferences as men, required a good education, or were as happy as men.",D,D,1,1664,235,1899,

Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect because women exert their influence within the home and family life. Beecher argues that women are designed to have a subordinate relation in society to men, but this does not mean that their duties or influence should be any less important. Instead, women are to win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved, and thus exerting their influence in the domestic and social circle. Therefore, option B is the best answer.","Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph (lines 22-37), Beecher suggests that women can be ""so much respected, esteemed and loved"" by those around them that men will accede to their wishes: ""then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly ...."" These lines show that Beecher believes women can influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect influence on public life. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because lines 34-37 make it clear that Beecher believes women do have an effect on society, even if it is an indirect effect. Beecher does not indicate that women's effect on public life is ignored because most men are not interested (choice $A$ ), unnecessary because men do not need help governing society (choice C), or merely symbolic because women tend to be idealistic (choice D).",B,B,1,1725,131,1856,

This suggests that Eppie's expanding awareness and engagement with the world are connected to Silas's increasing engagement with life, supporting choice B.

It's important to note that the correct answer is choice B, and the other choices are not mentioned in the passage as connections between Eppie and Silas.","Choice B is the best answer.

Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beveridge describes the United States as ""a land set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe"" and notes that it is ""a greater England with a nobler destiny."" He also emphasizes that the United States has been ""planted on this soil"" by God and that it is ""a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes."" These statements suggest that Beveridge views the resources and immensity of the United States as a divine gift to the American people, rather than a safeguard against foreign invasion (choice A), a replication of conditions in Europe (choice B), or a source of envy for people in other countries (choice D). Therefore, the best answer is choice C.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge portrays America as ""a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe."" Thus, in Passage 1, Beveridge asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift to the American people.Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because Beveridge envisions Americans occupying foreign lands, not being subject to foreign invasion; moreover, he asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift, not a safeguard against invasion.Choice B is incorrect because Beveridge asserts that American society constitutes an improvement on English society, not that the resources and immensity of the United States replicate conditions in Europe. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't assert that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a source of envy for people in other countries.",C,C,1,1602,190,1792,

The passage then focuses on the narrator's favorite bookshop and how the bookseller there allows them to read books for free and gifts them a volume of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations."" The passage culminates in the narrator expressing their desire to learn to write like Dickens.

Context: The passage discusses a study conducted by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues to investigate the presence of slow-conducting nerve fibers in human hairy skin.

The results showed that slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure were present in human hairy skin, and these fibers were found to convey a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers. The study also involved testing a patient known as G.L., who had an unusual nerve defect that affected her quick-conducting fibers, and found that she could still sense warmth and feel a pleasant sensation when her arm was gently brushed.

After re-reading the passage and reflecting on my previous answer, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is option D: manifestation of an innate drive in humans toward self-rule. Bryan argues that the desire for self-government is a fundamental aspect of human nature, and that God has placed the love of liberty in every human heart. This suggests that the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule is an innate drive in humans, rather than a reaction to imperial governments, a sign of belief in human equality, or a testament to the effects of US foreign policy.

","  Topic: English
Context: The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups. To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which can be of four different types. Two of the possible bases-adenine and guanine- are purines, and the other two-thymine and cytosine-are pyrimidines. So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of phosphate, sugar, and base, is known as a nucleotide. The first feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists not of one chain but of two. These two chains are both coiled around a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula, there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two. The other biologically important feature is the manner in which the two chains are held together. This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single base from the other. The important point is that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure. One member of a pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for example, there would not be room for it. We believe that the bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine. Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but when it does, its partner on the other chain must always be thymine. The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a long molecule, many different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of bases is the code that carries the genetical information. If the actual order of the bases on one of the pair of chains were given, one could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one, because of the specific pairing. Thus, one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is this feature that suggests how the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule might duplicate itself. The table shows, for various organisms, the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in that organism's DNA.

  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov tested Hodick and Sievers' model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap. However, the passage also states that Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers' model, as he applied an electrical current directly to the trap, rather than measuring the electric charge of the leaf. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers' model was incorrect.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.

Option D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate whether the technology Volkov used had been available to Hodick and Sievers when they formulated their model.",B,B,1,1677,237,1914,

The passage implies that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in a V formation, as the author states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. However, the author does not mention anything about their communication methods, migration routes, or energy expenditure, so options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are not implied by the passage.

In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication.

  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
Lincoln's argument in Passage 2 suggests that the controversy over slavery is caused by efforts to spread it into new territory, and that limiting it to its present bounds would lead to peace. Therefore, he would likely agree that abandoning attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced would abate the controversy.

This answer is consistent with Lincoln's argument in Passage 2, which emphasizes the need to limit slavery to its present bounds in order to achieve peace. Choice B aligns with this argument, as it suggests that ending attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced would help to abate the controversy.

The other answer choices do not align with Lincoln's argument in Passage 2. Choice A suggests that the controversy can be ended only if Northern states act unilaterally to abolish slavery throughout the United States, which is not consistent with Lincoln's argument that limiting slavery to its present bounds would lead to peace. Choice C suggests that the controversy has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves, which is not addressed in Passage 2. Choice D suggests that the controversy is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state, which is not a point made in Passage 2.","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Lincoln never attributes the controversy over slavery to differences in religion or social values from one state to another.",B,B,1,1691,306,1997,

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The passage states that the Venus flytrap needs to conserve its energy supply, as closing its trap requires a significant amount of energy and reopening it can take several hours. The plant achieves this by requiring multiple triggers (the touch of two hairs) to spring the trap closed, which ensures that it only closes when a large enough insect is present, making it worth the energy expenditure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey.

Option B is incorrect because while calcium is involved in the mechanism of the Venus flytrap's closure, the passage does not suggest that the plant's calcium reserves are a concern.

Option D is incorrect because while the plant does need to wait for a second trigger before closing, this is not done to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey, but rather to ensure that it only closes when a large enough insect is present.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1641,234,1875,

Advice: Pay attention to the context and the details provided in the paragraph.

Explanation:
The first paragraph describes a culture by presenting a situation where a man, Akira, comes to ask for Naomi's hand in marriage. It highlights the cultural significance of the fact that Akira has come directly, breaking all tradition, and that he has asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between. It also shows Chie's surprise at Akira's sudden proposal and her attitude towards the situation, which reflects her cultural background. Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to describe a culture.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1579,198,1777,

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:

In Passage 1, Beveridge presents liberty as a noble ideal that has been bestowed upon the United States by God and emphasizes the country's destiny to spread this liberty to other regions through imperial expansion. On the other hand, in Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principles of self-government and popular sovereignty, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, should not be repudiated in the Philippines or elsewhere. Bryan sees liberty as a fundamental right that all people possess and warns against the negative consequences of imperialism on both the colonized people and the United States itself.

Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best choice, as it accurately describes the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty. Beveridge sees liberty as something that can be exported through conquest, while Bryan sees it as a fundamental right that should not be compromised through imperial expansion.

In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization.
