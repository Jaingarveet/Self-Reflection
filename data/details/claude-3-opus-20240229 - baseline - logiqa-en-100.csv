  C: An education system that does not allow everyone to enjoy the right to compulsory education is unreasonable.
  D: There should be more requirements for a reasonable education system.
","Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that a reasonable education system requires two things:
   a. Everyone has the right to compulsory education.
   b. Access to higher education is through fair competition.
2. Choice A says an education system that doesn't allow everyone to go to college is unreasonable. However, the passage states that access to higher education should be through fair competition, not that everyone must be allowed to go to college. So A is incorrect.
3. Choice B says an education system that guarantees everyone compulsory education is reasonable. This aligns with the first requirement stated in the passage. So B could be a valid conclusion.
4. Choice C says an education system that doesn't allow everyone the right to compulsory education is unreasonable. This also follows logically from the first requirement in the passage. If a reasonable system requires everyone to have the right to compulsory education, then a system that doesn't provide this is unreasonable.
5. Choice D says there should be more requirements for a reasonable education system. While this might be true, it doesn't follow from the information given in the passage. The passage only discusses two specific requirements.
Therefore, both B and C are conclusions that can be drawn from the passage. However, since the question asks for the best conclusion, C is the most comprehensive and directly addresses the requirements for a reasonable system.

","To logically predict the result of the match between Chess player A and C, let's analyze the information given:
1. After the first round, the remaining six players are of equal strength.
2. In the played rounds:
   - Chess player A defeated Chess player B
   - Chess player B defeated Chess player C
Given that all players are of equal strength, the previous results don't necessarily predict the outcome of the match between A and C. While A defeated B, and B defeated C, this doesn't mean A will definitely win against C, as other factors like strategy, mental state, and even luck on the day can influence the result.
However, based on the transitive property, if A > B and B > C, then it's reasonable to assume A > C. So while not guaranteed, Chess player A has a higher likelihood of winning against C.

The paragraph states that to start a successful company, you must excel in at least one area compared to your competitors. This could be having a better product, being faster, having lower costs, or providing higher added value.
Looking at the choices:
A. This accurately captures the main idea - a company needs to be the best in at least one aspect to compete in the market.
B. While similar to A, this choice is too extreme. The paragraph doesn't say a company will definitely lose if it's not the best, just that it needs an advantage to succeed.
C. The paragraph doesn't mention huge profits, just the ability to gain a foothold in the market. This choice goes beyond what's stated.
D. This is very close to A, but the phrasing is more extreme with ""cannot succeed"" vs. A's ""gain a foothold"". The paragraph suggests being the best in one area helps a company compete, but doesn't say it's an absolute requirement for any success.
Therefore, choice A is closest in meaning to the original paragraph. It correctly summarizes the main point without adding unmentioned details or using language that's too strong.

A: If people don't know what they really need, then their demand messages through free speech may not accurately reflect their real needs. This weakens the argument that free speech is essential for the government to meet the people's needs.
B: If free speech disrupts social order, and social order is necessary for meeting the needs of the masses, then free speech could actually hinder the government's ability to meet the people's needs. This weakens the argument.
C: If the legitimate function of the government is to provide equal opportunities rather than satisfy the needs of the people, then the argument's premise that the government's function is to meet the people's needs is challenged. This weakens the argument.
D: This choice suggests that free speech alone is not enough to satisfy the needs of the masses and that good social order is also essential.

1. The context states that seals died from eating fish contaminated with chemicals, and even small amounts can poison mammals. However, some people who ate the fish were not poisoned. This seems contradictory.
2. Choice A states that the fish itself is not harmed by the chemical. This doesn't explain why people weren't poisoned while seals were.
3. Choice B suggests that the toxic chemicals gather in parts of the fish that seals eat but people don't. This could explain why seals were poisoned but people weren't - they ate different parts of the fish.

1. When polluting industries are transferred from developed to developing countries:
   - Developed countries benefit from improved natural environment
   - Developing countries are compensated with increased employment and taxes, despite the environmental pollution
2. As a result, both sides benefit, leading to an increase in total global welfare.
Now, let's examine each choice to determine which one is a necessary assumption (hypothesis) for the economist's argument:
A. The relative importance of a good natural environment for people in developed vs. developing countries is not discussed in the argument. The argument does not rely on this assumption.
B. The existence of polluting enterprises in both developed and developing countries is not a necessary assumption. The argument focuses on the transfer of these industries from one to the other.
C. The relative degree of environmental pollution between developed and developing countries is not mentioned or assumed in the argument.
D. The economist's argument relies on the assumption that polluting industries can generate more profits (through increased employment and taxes) in developing countries than in developed countries. This assumption is necessary for the claim that the transfer leads to an overall improvement in global welfare.
Therefore, the hypothesis discussed by the economist is:

  D: It is expected that the price of aluminum alloy materials will remain stable, while the price of steel materials may decline.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The conclusion is that from a financial perspective, it's not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy ones, even though aluminum alloy vehicles provide the same protection and are lighter.
2. The reason given is that the manufacturing cost of an aluminum alloy armored vehicle is twice that of a steel one.
3. To raise doubts about this conclusion, we need to find a choice that provides a compelling financial reason to switch to aluminum alloy despite the higher manufacturing cost.
4. Choice A states that the running cost of an aluminum alloy vehicle is one-third of a steel one with the same performance. This suggests that the long-term operational savings could outweigh the initial higher manufacturing cost, casting doubt on the conclusion.
5. Choices B, C, and D don't provide strong financial reasons to prefer aluminum alloy over steel. They talk about maintenance costs and material prices, but not in a way that clearly challenges the conclusion.
Therefore, choice A raises the greatest doubt about the conclusion by suggesting that lower running costs could make aluminum alloy financially preferable despite higher upfront costs.

D: High-income groups being less sensitive to small price increases does not directly explain why there is a gap between the CPI statistics and the feelings of the general population.

That's because the sample only includes people who died during their college years, not a representative sample of all college-educated people.

A: This suggests that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia, which could be due to factors other than just climate drought. This choice questions the opinion.
B: The fact that grasslands in Mongolia are still thriving while those in Inner Mongolia have degraded suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible. This choice questions the opinion.
C: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.
D: This choice directly states that human factors, such as overgrazing and poor grassland management, are the main causes of increased dust storms. It supports the idea that the given opinion can be questioned.

A. If the scientist and one American are husband and wife, they are still 2 separate people. This doesn't resolve the discrepancy.
B. The export destination of an entrepreneur's products doesn't affect the number of people on the helicopter.
C. If two entrepreneurs are Chinese and another American is a lawyer, this accounts for the overlap. The two Chinese entrepreneurs contribute to both the ""2 entrepreneurs"" and ""4 Chinese"" totals.

B: If magazines with violent and pornographic content generally have low credibility despite good sales, it provides a reason for advertisers to leave beyond just ethical considerations (e.g., to protect their brand image). This weakens the argument.
C: If the advertisers who left primarily promoted household goods, it implies their target audience may not align with the new content, giving them a business reason to advertise elsewhere. This weakens the argument that their decision was based on ethics.
D: If the advertising cost increased significantly after the name change, it provides an alternative explanation for why the advertisers left - the higher cost may not have been justified from a business perspective.

   - If H and Y are in sales, then I, W, and X cannot all be in sales (since there are only 3 spots in sales). So at least one of I, W, or X must be in production or public relations.
   - If H and Y are in public relations, then I, W, and X must be split between production and sales.
4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. This eliminates the possibility of H and Y being in production (because then X would be in sales and W would also have to be in sales, which is not possible).
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   - G and I could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).
   - G and X could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).
   - G and Y cannot be in sales together, because H and Y must be in the same department, and if H and Y are in sales, then G must be in public relations.
   - H and W could potentially be in sales together (if X is in production or public relations).
Therefore, the pair that is unlikely to be in sales together is G and Y.

","To determine the best argument against the claim that more wealthy Chinese people are transferring their assets abroad, let's analyze each choice:
A: If the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased despite the 23% increase in turnover, it suggests that the average transaction size has increased rather than the number of buyers. This could argue against the idea of more wealthy Chinese transferring assets abroad.
B: The presence of real estate speculators among wealthy Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai does not directly address the claim about transferring assets abroad. It is not a strong counterargument.
C: If the US real estate market has had low risk and good potential for value preservation and appreciation in recent years, it could explain the increased investment from Chinese buyers as a financially sound decision rather than a transfer of assets abroad.
Considering the above, choice A provides the best argument against the claim. If the number of Chinese buyers has not increased, it weakens the argument that more wealthy Chinese are transferring assets abroad.

2. ""Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs"" means ""hostage holding (see) reporter""
3. ""Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits"" means ""kidnapping reporters away""
From sentence 1, we can infer that either ""Doximayo"" means ""student"" or ""hostage"".

   - Valve No.5 must be closed.
3. Now, according to rule (2), if valve No.2 is opened, then:

2. It also states that there is an inverse relationship between cost and profit - if cost is high, profit is low, and vice versa.
3. This implies that there is a conflict of interest between the boss and the employees. The boss wants to maximize profit, which means minimizing cost (and thus wages). Employees, on the other hand, want to maximize their wages.

   A suggests that if employees hold shares, there is a conflict of interest with the boss. This doesn't follow from the given information.

","To determine which reasoning shows the argument is invalid, we need to find a choice that follows the same logical structure but leads to an obviously false conclusion.
The original argument has the form:
- All P are Q
- R are not P
- Therefore, R are not Q
Let's examine each choice:
A) This has the form:
   - All P have to Q
   - I am not P
   - Therefore, I don't have to Q
   This matches the original argument's structure and the conclusion is clearly false, showing the invalidity of the original argument.
B) This does not match the original structure. It has the form ""P has Q, R has Q, therefore R is P"", which is different.
C) This also does not match. It has the form ""All P are Q. R is P. Therefore, R is Q"", which is a valid argument form.
D) This also does not match. It just states that criminal behaviors, being illegal, should be condemned by society.
Therefore, choice A is the only one that clearly shows the original argument is invalid by using the same structure to reach a false conclusion.

1. The printing group has G, H, and L as its only members.
2. The binding group must have at least 3 members (condition 1).
3. F and K cannot be in the same group (condition 2), so if K is in the binding group, F cannot be.
4. If K is in the binding group, J must also be in the binding group (condition 3).
5. M must be in at least one of the groups (condition 4).
6. The two groups should have as many common members as possible (given).
7. The printing group does not include F, J, K, or M. So the only possible common members are G, H, and L.
8. To maximize common members, the binding group should include G, H, and L. This satisfies the requirement of at least 3 members.

A: This choice discusses invertebrates in the ocean, not insects specifically. While it suggests a correlation between oxygen content and organism size, it doesn't directly support the argument about insects and their stomata system.

C: This choice discusses the survival of locusts in low-oxygen environments but doesn't address the relationship between oxygen content and insect size, which is the main point of the argument.
D: This choice presents experimental evidence that fruit flies increased in size when raised in a high-oxygen, high-pressure environment. While this supports the idea that oxygen content can affect insect size, it introduces the additional variable of air pressure, which is not mentioned in the original argument.

B: If the moths also eat other wild grasses in the northern hemisphere, it could potentially cause unintended ecological consequences. The proposal's success depends on the moths primarily targeting the European fern, not on them eating other plants.
C: For the proposal to succeed, the introduced moths must be able to survive in the northern hemisphere climate and reproduce sufficiently to create a population large enough to significantly reduce the European fern's growth and spread. If the moths cannot thrive or reach adequate numbers, they will not effectively control the fern.

4. Paying this percentage of social insurance premiums reduces the competitiveness of the enterprises.
Looking at the choices:
A. This conclusion is too strong. The context doesn't state that the country can only maintain one or the other. It's possible there could be a balance or compromise.
B. This choice is reasonable. If the percentage of social insurance premiums paid by companies is reduced, it would help maintain their competitiveness.
C. This conclusion is also too strong, for the same reason as choice A. The context doesn't imply that the country can maintain neither economic development nor social stability.
D. This choice logically follows from the context. If enterprises pay the social insurance premiums, which are necessary for social stability, it will reduce their competitiveness and thus affect the country's economic development to some extent.

  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth
","To determine which choice best supports the research findings, let's consider each option:
A: The rock being formed from ancient deep seabed accumulation doesn't directly support the presence of meteorites or the impact event.
B: The extinction of ammonites and other species in the late Triassic period is consistent with the timeline of the impact (215 million years ago), but it doesn't specifically support the presence of meteorites or the impact event itself.
C: The high concentrations of iridium and platinum being peculiar to meteorites and rare on Earth's surface strongly supports the presence of meteorites in the clay layer, as the researchers found these elements at 50 to 2000 times their normal concentrations.
D: While the occurrence of many meteorite impacts in ancient times provides general context, it doesn't directly support the specific findings of this research.
Therefore, choice C provides the best support for the research findings, as it directly corroborates the presence of meteorites based on the high concentrations of iridium and platinum found in the clay layer.

","Let's analyze the statements of each professor:
1. Professor Zhao: ""The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.""
   - This means the champion could be either the China University of Science and Technology team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.
2. Professor Qian: ""The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.""
   - This directly states that the champion is the China University of Science and Technology team.
3. Professor Sun: ""The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.""
   - This directly states that the champion is the Tsinghua University team.
We know that only one professor judged both correctly, one judged one-to-one wrong, and the other was completely wrong.
- If Professor Zhao is correct, then either Professor Qian or Professor Sun must be completely wrong, and the other must be one-to-one wrong. However, this is not possible because their statements directly contradict each other.
- If Professor Qian is correct, then Professor Zhao is one-to-one wrong (correct about Tsinghua University not being the champion, but wrong about Zhejiang University), and Professor Sun is completely wrong.
- If Professor Sun is correct, then Professor Zhao is one-to-one wrong (correct about Zhejiang University not being the champion, but wrong about Tsinghua University), and Professor Qian is completely wrong.
Therefore, the only consistent scenario is when Professor Qian is correct.

  C: Zhang Shan's view was weakened, Li Si's view was not affected.
  D: Both Zhang Shan and Li Si's views were weakened.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Zhang Shan's argument is based on the premise that the death penalty can prevent crime and minimize societal suffering. If it's assumed that the death penalty cannot prevent crime, then this key premise of Zhang Shan's argument is undermined. Thus, Zhang Shan's view would be weakened.
2. Li Si's argument is that regardless of whether the death penalty can prevent crime, the fundamental question is whether a society has the right to deprive anyone of life. This argument does not depend on the effectiveness of the death penalty in preventing crime. So even if we assume the death penalty cannot prevent crime, Li Si's view would not be affected.
Therefore, if we assume the death penalty cannot prevent crime, Zhang Shan's view would be weakened, while Li Si's view would not be affected.
