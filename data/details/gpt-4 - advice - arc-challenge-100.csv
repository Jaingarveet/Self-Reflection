Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
All the materials listed can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Steel cans and glass bottles can be melted down and remade into new products many times without losing their quality. Paper and plastic, on the other hand, degrade each time they are recycled and can only be reused a limited number of times.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost is formed when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice). This process is known as deposition, but this option is not given. The closest option to deposition is condensation, which is the process where gas turns into a liquid. Although it's not the exact process, it's the closest one available in the choices.

After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought: 
The question is asking how the researchers can strengthen their conclusions about the effectiveness of the new antibiotic. While all the options are valid steps in the research process, the one that would most directly strengthen their conclusions is having an independent lab retest the antibiotic. This would provide independent verification of their results, which is a key aspect of scientific research.

Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Thought: 
All the options listed are traits that can be influenced by both genetics and environment. However, some traits are more heritable than others. Height, hair color, and skin color are highly heritable traits. Intelligence, while influenced by genetics, is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as education and upbringing. Therefore, intelligence is generally considered to be less heritable than the other traits listed.

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves forming a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, and then analyzing the results. If the results do not match the hypothesis, the experiment should be repeated to ensure that the results were not due to an error in the experiment. If the results consistently do not match the hypothesis after several repetitions, then the hypothesis may need to be reconsidered. Therefore, Michelle should repeat the investigation.
