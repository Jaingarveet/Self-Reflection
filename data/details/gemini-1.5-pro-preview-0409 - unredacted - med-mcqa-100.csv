Action: Answer(""D"") 
","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

","Answer is C (surgery): The baffling aspect of the question is that it does not mention whether it is a small cell carcinoma or a non small cell carcinoma as this histological distinction is the bases of the primary modality of treatment. Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease. Most small cell carcinomas have already spread at the time of presentation beyond the bounds of surgery and they are managed primarily by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Primary modality of treatment is surgery -- pulmonary resection. * Advanced disease: Radiotherapy with curative intent is advocated (+- chemotherapy) * Metastatic disease (Stage IV) symptomatic/suppoive If we were to go by the information available in the question, The maximum tumor size (T) is = 5 cm ( 3), i.e. T2 There is no nodal involvement (No) There is no distal metastases (Mo) Thus it is T2 No Mo disease or stage I disease The treatment of choice for stage I disease is surgery i.e. Pulmonary resection The tumor in question has no nodal involvement and no metastases and hence is likely to be a non small cell carcinoma. Fuher, according to oxford textbook of surgery 2""d/2480 ""Recent data suggest that staging small cell lung cancer using TNM system employed for non small cell carcinomas may be helpful.
