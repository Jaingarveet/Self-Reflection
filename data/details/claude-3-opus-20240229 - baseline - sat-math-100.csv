","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We are given the equation $h=-16t^2+vt+k$, and we need to solve for $v$.
2) First, let's isolate the term containing $v$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting $k$ from both sides:
   $h-k=-16t^2+vt$
3) Now, let's add $16t^2$ to both sides to isolate $vt$:
   $h-k+16t^2=vt$
4) Finally, we can divide both sides by $t$ to isolate $v$:
   $\frac{h-k+16t^2}{t}=v$
5) Simplifying the left side:
   $\frac{h-k}{t}+16t=v$
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16t$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Starting with the original equation, $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, in order to get $v$ in terms of the other variables, $-16 t^{2}$ and $k$ need to be subtracted from each side.

However, the equation $v=\frac{h+16 t^{2}-k}{t}$ is not one of the options, so the right side needs to be further simplified. Another way to write the previous equation is $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+\frac{16 t^{2}}{t}$, which can be simplified to $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$.

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) For a line to pass through the origin (0, 0), it must satisfy the equation $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope of the line.
2) The slope of a line can be calculated using the formula:
   $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
   where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are any two points on the line.
3) Using the given points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$, we can calculate the slope:
   $m = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$
4) Since the line passes through the origin, we can use the point-slope form of a line equation:
   $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$
   Substituting the point $(2, k)$ and the slope we found:
   $y - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(x - 2)$
5) Now, for the line to pass through the origin, the equation must be satisfied when $x = 0$ and $y = 0$. Substituting these values:
   $0 - k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(0 - 2)$
   Simplifying:
   $-k = \frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(-2)$
   $-k = \frac{2k - 64}{k - 2}$
6) For this to be true, the numerators must be equal:
   $-k(k - 2) = 2k - 64$
   $-k^2 + 2k = 2k - 64$
   $-k^2 = -64$

  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We need to find when the price of beef (b) is equal to the price of chicken (c). In other words, we need to solve the equation:

2) Subtract 1.75 from both sides:
   $0.60 + 0.25x = 0.40x$
3) Subtract 0.25x from both sides:
   $0.60 = 0.15x$
4) Divide both sides by 0.15:

   $b = 2.35 + 0.25(4)$

3) The 8% sales tax is applied to this discounted price. So the total price Alma paid is:
   $p = 1.08(0.8x)$
   (The tax is 8% of the discounted price, so the total is 108% of the discounted price.)
4) Simplifying the right side of the equation:
   $p = 0.864x$
5) To express $x$ (the original price) in terms of $p$, we divide both sides by 0.864:
   $x = \frac{p}{0.864}$
6) $0.864 = (0.8)(1.08)$, so this can also be written as:

","Let's analyze the study design and results step-by-step:
1. The study selected a random sample of 300 participants from a large population of people with poor eyesight. This random selection helps ensure the sample is representative of the population.
2. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving treatment X and the other not receiving treatment X. This random assignment helps control for potential confounding variables and establishes a cause-and-effect relationship.
3. The results showed that participants who received treatment X had significantly improved eyesight compared to those who did not receive treatment X. This suggests that treatment X was effective in improving eyesight.
4. The study only compared treatment X to no treatment, not to other available treatments. Therefore, we cannot conclude that treatment X is better than all other treatments.

Experimental research is a method used to study a small group of people and generalize the results to a larger population.

In this study, all conditions are met and the population from which the participants were selected are people with poor eyesight. Therefore, a general conclusion can be drawn about the effect of Treatment $\mathrm{X}$ on the population of people with poor eyesight. Choice B is incorrect. The study did not include all available treatments, so no conclusion can be made about the relative effectiveness of all available treatments. Choice $C$ is incorrect. The participants were selected at random from a large population of people with poor eyesight. Therefore, the results can be generalized only to that population and not to anyone in general.

1) The expression is $2x(x^2 - 3x)$. This is a product of two terms.
2) To multiply these terms, we distribute $2x$ to each term inside the parentheses:

2) We're told that $X_{2010} = 120,000$ and that $X_{2015} = 1.2X_{2010}$ (because of the 20% increase).
3) So, $X_{2015} = 1.2 \times 120,000 = 144,000$.
4) We're also told that in 2015, the populations of City X and City Y were equal. So, $Y_{2015} = X_{2015} = 144,000$.
5) Now, we need to work backwards to find $Y_{2010}$. We're told that the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. In other words, $Y_{2015} = 0.9Y_{2010}$.
6) Substituting what we know, $144,000 = 0.9Y_{2010}$.
7) Solving for $Y_{2010}$:
   $Y_{2010} = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000$

1) In a linear relationship, the equation is of the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table. Let's use $(a, 0)$ and $(3a, -a)$:

   $0 = -\frac{1}{2}a + b$
   $b = \frac{1}{2}a$
4) So, the equation is $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}a$

1) The equation is in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) The slope $m$ represents the rate of change of $y$ (average number of students per classroom) with respect to $x$ (number of years since 2000).
3) The y-intercept $b$ represents the value of $y$ when $x = 0$, i.e., the average number of students per classroom in the year 2000.
4) In the given equation, the slope is 0.56. This means that the average number of students per classroom is increasing by 0.56 each year.
5) The y-intercept is 27.2, which means that the average number of students per classroom in 2000 was 27.2.

3) We can express this as an equation:

1) First, let's square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root:
   $(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
   $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
2) Now, let's rearrange the equation to standard form:
   $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$
3) We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:
   $(x - 1)(x - 9) = 0$
4) The solutions are the values that make each factor equal to zero:
   $x - 1 = 0$ or $x - 9 = 0$
   $x = 1$ or $x = 9$
5) However, we need to check these solutions in the original equation because squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions.
   For $x = 1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 1 - 3$
               $2 = -2$ (False)
   For $x = 9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3$

Therefore, only $x = 9$ satisfies the original equation.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$ yields $4 x=(x-3)^{2}$, or $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$.

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$.

2) Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope but different y-intercepts.

   For the first equation: 
   $-3x + y = 6$
   $y = 3x + 6$
   
   For the second equation:
   $ax + 2y = 4$
   $2y = -ax + 4$
   $y = -\frac{a}{2}x + 2$
4) For the lines to be parallel, the slopes must be equal:
   
   $3 = -\frac{a}{2}$
   $-6 = a$
5) Therefore, when $a = -6$, the lines will be parallel.
6) Now, let's check if the y-intercepts are different when $a = -6$:
   
   First equation: y-intercept is 6

1) If the equation $(ax+2)(bx+7)=15x^2+cx+14$ holds for all values of $x$, then it's an identity. This means that the coefficients of like terms on both sides must be equal.
2) Expand the left side of the equation:
   
   $(ax+2)(bx+7) = abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14 = abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$
3) Equating the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constant terms on both sides:
   
   $ab = 15$
   $7a + 2b = c$
   $14 = 14$
4) We're given that $a + b = 8$. Let's solve for $a$ and $b$.
   
   From $ab = 15$, we can write $b = 15/a$.
   Substituting this in $a + b = 8$:
   
   $a + 15/a = 8$
   
   Multiplying by $a$:
   
   $a^2 + 15 = 8a$
   $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$
   
   This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:
   
   $(a - 3)(a - 5) = 0$
   
   So, $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. Correspondingly, $b = 5$ or $b = 3$.
5) Now, let's find the values of $c$. From $7a + 2b = c$:
   
   If $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, then $c = 7(3) + 2(5) = 31$.
   If $a = 5$ and $b = 3$, then $c = 7(5) + 2(3) = 41$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

   $6x-8 = 9x-6$

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) First, we need to find the average number of earthworms per square meter. To do this, we sum up the number of earthworms in each region and divide by the number of regions.
   Total earthworms = 107 + 147 + 146 + 135 + 149 + 141 + 150 + 154 + 176 + 166 = 1,471
   Average earthworms per square meter = 1,471 / 10 = 147.1
2) Now, we know the average number of earthworms in a 1m x 1m area. The entire field is 10m x 10m, which is an area of 100 square meters.
3) To estimate the total number of earthworms in the field, we multiply the average number of earthworms per square meter by the total area of the field in square meters.
   Estimated total earthworms = 147.1 * 100 = 14,710
4) Looking at the choices, the closest answer to 14,710 is 15,000.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The area of the field is 100 square meters. Each 1-meter-by-1-meter square has an area of 1 square meter.

","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We're told there's a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight. This means the function will be of the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
2) To find the slope, let's choose two points from the table. Let's use (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89).
   Slope = $\frac{change\text{ }in\text{ }y}{change\text{ }in\text{ }x} = \frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = \frac{4.95}{5} = 0.99$
   So, $m = 0.99$.
3) Now that we have the slope, we can use any point to find the y-intercept. Let's use (5, 16.94).
   $16.94 = 0.99(5) + b$
   $16.94 = 4.95 + b$
   $b = 16.94 - 4.95 = 11.99$
4) Therefore, the function is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$. Therefore, the function $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$ can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds. Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect. If any pair of values from the table is substituted for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, in these functions, the result is false.

Similarly, substituting the values $(10,21.89)$ for $x$ and $f(x)$ into the functions in choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ results in $21.89=33.9$ and $21.89=50.84$, respectively.

1) First, let's calculate the mean, median, and range with the 24-inch measurement included.
   Mean = (8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 14 + 15 + 15 + 16 + 24) / 21 = 12.38 inches
   Median = 12 inches (the 11th value when sorted)
   Range = 24 - 8 = 16 inches
2) Now, let's remove the 24-inch measurement and recalculate:
   Mean = (8 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 14 + 14 + 15 + 15 + 16) / 20 = 12.15 inches
   Median = 12 inches (still the 10th value when sorted)
   Range = 16 - 8 = 8 inches
3) Let's compare the changes:
   Mean: 12.38 - 12.15 = 0.23 inch change
   Median: No change
   Range: 16 - 8 = 8 inch change
The range changed the most when the outlier was removed.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

1) The equation for the speed of sound is given as $S(T) = 0.6T + 331.4$. This is a linear function.
2) In a linear function $y = mx + b$, $b$ represents the y-intercept, which is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$.
3) In this context, $T$ is the independent variable (like $x$) and $S$ is the dependent variable (like $y$). 
4) So, 331.4 represents the value of $S$ when $T = 0$. In other words, it's the speed of sound when the temperature is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
5) The coefficient 0.6 represents the slope of the line, which is the change in $S$ for a unit change in $T$. Specifically, it's the increase in the speed of sound (in m/s) for a $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature.

   5*F_L + 9*(18 - F_L) = 122
   5*F_L + 162 - 9*F_L = 122
   -4*F_L = -40
   F_L = 10
   Substituting this back into the equation M_L = 18 - F_L:
   M_L = 18 - 10 = 8
6) Now that we have F_L and M_L, we can calculate F_R and M_R:
   F_R = 5 * F_L = 5 * 10 = 50
   M_R = 9 * M_L = 9 * 8 = 72
7) The probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:
   P(Right-handed and Female) = F_R / (F_R + M_R) = 50 / (50 + 72) = 50 / 122 ≈ 0.410
Therefore, the answer closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is 0.410.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is correct. Let $x$ be the number of left-handed female students and let $y$ be the number of left-handed male students.

Since the total number of lefthanded students is 18 and the total number of right-handed students is 122 , the system of equations below must be satisfied.$$\left\{\begin{array}{c}x+y=18 \\5 x+9 y=122\end{array}\right.$$Solving this system gives $x=10$ and $y=8$.

","Let's solve this step-by-step:
1) We have a system of two linear equations with two variables:
   
   $2x - 3y = -14$
   $3x - 2y = -6$
2) We can solve this using the substitution method. Let's solve the second equation for $y$:
   
   $3x - 2y = -6$
   $-2y = -3x - 6$
   $y = \frac{3x + 6}{2}$
3) Now substitute this value of $y$ into the first equation:
   
   $2x - 3(\frac{3x + 6}{2}) = -14$
   $2x - \frac{9x + 18}{2} = -14$
   $4x - (9x + 18) = -28$
   $4x - 9x - 18 = -28$
   $-5x - 18 = -28$
   $-5x = -10$
   $x = 2$
4) Now that we have $x$, we can find $y$ by substituting $x = 2$ into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:
   
   $2(2) - 3y = -14$
   $4 - 3y = -14$
   $-3y = -18$
   $y = 6$

Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$.

1. Understand the given information:
   * Type A trees produce 20% more pears than Type B trees.
   * Type A trees produced 144 pears.
2. To find the number of pears produced by Type B trees, we need to work backward from the number of pears produced by Type A trees.
3. If we consider the number of pears produced by Type B trees as 100%, then Type A trees produce 120% (100% + 20%) of that amount.
4. Let's say Type B trees produced x pears. Then, Type A trees produced 1.2x pears.
5. We know that Type A trees produced 144 pears, so we can set up an equation:
   * 1.2x = 144
6. Solve the equation for x:
   * x = 144 ÷ 1.2
   * x = 120
Therefore, Type B trees produced 120 pears.

3) Let's check each point:
   A: (0,7) - This point has the same y-coordinate as the slope (7), but it's not on the line because it doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (0,7) would be a vertical line, not a line with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
   B: (1,7) - This point doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (1,7) would mean moving 1 unit horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 7, not $\frac{1}{7}$.
   C: (7,7) - This point also doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (7,7) would mean moving 7 units horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 1, not $\frac{1}{7}$.
   D: (14,2) - This point does follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (14,2) means moving 14 units horizontally and 2 units vertically. This is equivalent to moving 7 units horizontally and 1 unit vertically twice, which matches the slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.

1) Let the number of students in the class be $s$.
2) If each student gets 3 milliliters, and there are 5 milliliters left over, we can write:
   
   $n = 3s + 5$
3) If each student gets 4 milliliters, the teacher needs an additional 21 milliliters. This means:
   
   $n + 21 = 4s$
4) From (2) and (3), we can write:
   
   $3s + 5 + 21 = 4s$
5) Simplifying:
   
   $3s + 26 = 4s$

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) The question asks for the weight of an object on Mercury. To find this, we need to use the formula $W = mg$, where:
   - $W$ is the weight in newtons (N)
   - $m$ is the mass in kilograms (kg)
   - $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity in $\frac{m}{sec^2}$
2) We are given that the mass of the object is 90 kg.
3) From the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury is 3.6 $\frac{m}{sec^2}$.
4) Now, let's substitute these values into the formula:
   $W = mg$
   $W = 90 \times 3.6$
   $W = 324$ N
Therefore, the weight of the object on Mercury is 324 newtons.

3) To find the range of plausible values for the true percentage, we subtract and add the margin of error to the estimate:
   Lower bound: 23% - 4% = 19%

1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.
2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.
4) To find his current weekly expenditure on gasoline:
   - Miles per week / Miles per gallon = Gallons of gasoline used per week
   - 100 / 25 = 4 gallons per week
   - Gallons per week * Price per gallon = Weekly expenditure
   - 4 * $4 = $16 per week
5) Alan wants to reduce this by $5. So his new weekly expenditure should be:
   - Current expenditure - Desired reduction = New expenditure
   - $16 - $5 = $11
6) Let's say he drives $m$ miles less per week. His new miles per week would be:
   - Current miles - Reduced miles = New miles per week
   - 100 - $m$ = New miles per week
7) With this new mileage, his new weekly expenditure should be $11. We can set up an equation:
   - (New miles per week / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = New expenditure
   - ((100 - $m$) / 25) * $4 = $11
8) Simplify:
   - (100 - $m$) / 25 = 11 / 4

1) The probability of a user answering ""Always"" given they did not answer ""Never"" is a conditional probability. We can calculate this using the formula:
   P(Always | Not Never) = P(Always and Not Never) / P(Not Never)
2) P(Always and Not Never) is just P(Always), because ""Always"" and ""Never"" are mutually exclusive. From the table, P(Always) = 30.9% = 0.309.
3) To find P(Not Never), we can subtract P(Never) from 1:
   
   P(Not Never) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687
4) Now we can calculate the conditional probability:
   P(Always | Not Never) = 0.309 / 0.687 ≈ 0.45

1) The model is a linear equation, where $h$ represents height (in inches) and $a$ represents age (in years).
2) In a linear equation, the coefficient of the variable (in this case, $a$) represents the rate of change. It tells us how much the dependent variable ($h$, height) changes for each unit increase in the independent variable ($a$, age).
3) In the given equation, $h=3a+28.6$, the coefficient of $a$ is 3. 
4) This means that for each year increase in age, the height is estimated to increase by 3 inches.
Therefore, the estimated increase in a boy's height each year is 3 inches.

1) The vertex form of a quadratic equation is $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.
2) To convert the given equation to vertex form, we need to expand it:
   $y = a(x^2 + 2x - 8)$
   
   $y = ax^2 + 2ax - 8a$
3) Now, we complete the square for the $x$ terms:
   $y = a(x^2 + 2x + 1 - 1) - 8a$
   
   $y = a(x + 1)^2 - a - 8a$
   
   $y = a(x + 1)^2 - 9a$
4) Now the equation is in vertex form. Comparing with $y = a(x - h)^2 + k$, we see that:
   $h = -1$ (the sign is flipped)

3) Statement II: If C increases by 1, then $\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ increases by 1. This means $(F-32)$ increases by $\frac{9}{5}$, so F increases by $\frac{9}{5}$, which is 1.8. So statement II is also true.

  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$
","Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We are told that $f$ is a linear function. The general form of a linear function is $f(n) = an + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
2) We can find $a$ and $b$ using the given values in the table. Let's use the points $(1, -2)$ and $(2, 1)$.
3) Using the point $(1, -2)$:
   $f(1) = a(1) + b = -2$
   $a + b = -2$ ... (Equation 1)
4) Using the point $(2, 1)$:
   $f(2) = a(2) + b = 1$
   $2a + b = 1$ ... (Equation 2)
5) Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:
   $(2a + b) - (a + b) = 1 - (-2)$
   $a = 3$
6) Substituting $a = 3$ into Equation 1:
   $3 + b = -2$
   $b = -5$

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line that passes through each of the points given in the table. From the table, one can see that an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$; for example, $f 2)-f(1)=1-(-2)=3$. Therefore, the graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line with slope 3. Only choice $\mathrm{C}$ is a line with slope 3. The $y$-intercept of the line is the value of $f(0)$. Since an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$, it follows that $f 1)-f(0)=3$. Since $f(1)=-2$, it follows that $f(0)=f(1)-3=-5$.

3) Since we're told that $x > 0$, we know that $3x > 0$ as well.

3) The new area is $1.1l(1-\frac{p}{100})w$. 
4) We are told that the new area is 88% of the original area (because it decreased by 12%). So:

The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$.
