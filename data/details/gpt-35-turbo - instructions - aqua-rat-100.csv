Let's assume the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)

Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Then, Mr.Black works for 6 days and completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 of the work.
The remaining work is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.
Let's set up an equation to solve for the time taken by Mr.Blue to complete the remaining work.

","Thought:
There are 10 different types of books, and each type can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If we use a single letter to represent each type, we need at least 10 letters. If we use a pair of two different letters to represent each type, we can use the combination formula to calculate the number of possible pairs: C(10,2) = 45. Therefore, we need at least 45 letters to represent each type with a pair of two different letters. Since we want to find the smallest number of letters, we should choose the smaller value, which is 10.
Action: Answer(""D"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

I made a mistake in my previous answer by not accounting for the fact that the question asks for the minimum selling price per component, not the total revenue needed.

Then, I can divide the required revenue by the number of units produced per year to find the minimum selling price per component.

To calculate the total production cost per year, I multiply the production cost per component by the number of units produced per month and then by 12 months:

To calculate the desired yearly profit, I add the desired profit to the total production cost per year: 
$554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
To calculate the required revenue from sales, I divide the desired yearly profit by the number of units produced per year: 
$1,180,800 ÷ 420 = $2,808
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $2,808, which is closest to answer choice D: 260.","450*12(x-110)=626400

5. The surface area of the hollow cube is 150cm^2 - 54cm^2 = 96cm^2.
6. The outer surface is made up of 5cm x 5cm = 25 smaller cubes.
7. The total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 6 x (5cm x 5cm x 1cm) = 150 faces.

","1. Let the speed of the ship be S.
   The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10S.
2. The ship traveled for some time before meeting the plane. Let the time it traveled be T.
   Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is D = ST.
3. The plane started flying after the ship had traveled 180 miles.
   Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is D + 180.
4. The total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented by the equation:
   D + 180 = (10S + S)T
5. The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is D = ST.
6. The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is D + 180.
7. Substituting the equation for D in the equation for the total distance traveled, we get:
   ST + 180 = 11ST
   180 = 10ST
   T = 18
8. Substituting T = 18 in the equation for D, we get:

6. Using the angle addition postulate, we can find the measure of minor arc AE:
   - Measure of minor arc AC = 160°
   - Measure of minor arc BE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc AC = 80°
   - Measure of minor arc AE = Measure of minor arc AB + Measure of minor arc BE = 80° + x (let x be the measure of minor arc AB)
   - Measure of minor arc AB = Measure of minor arc BD - Measure of minor arc AD = 150° - y (let y be the measure of minor arc AD)
   - Measure of minor arc DE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc BD = 75°
   - Measure of minor arc AD = Measure of minor arc AE + Measure of minor arc ED = (80° + x) + 75° = 155° + x
7. We know that B bisects minor arc AC, so angle ABC is congruent to angle CBD. Therefore, x = y.

Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"".
Let's call the time it takes for Kevin to drive from A to B ""t1"".
Let's call the time it takes for Kevin to drive from B to A ""t2"".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can set up the equation:
d = 70t1
We also know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can set up the equation:
d = 90t2
We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that at that point, he had already driven 2d - 70 miles. We can set up the equation:
2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90(t2 - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90t2 - 270
2d = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200
We can use the first two equations to substitute for d:
2(70t1) = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200
Simplifying this equation, we get:
140t1 = 90t2 + 200
We also know that t1 + t2 = total time of the trip. Let's call the total time of the trip ""T"":
t1 + t2 = T
We can solve for t2 in terms of t1:
t2 = T - t1
Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:
140t1 = 90(T - t1) + 200
Simplifying this equation, we get:
50t1 = 90T - 200
t1 = (90T - 200) / 50
We can use this expression to solve for t2:
t2 = T - t1
t2 = T - (90T - 200) / 50
t2 = (10T + 200) / 50
Now we can use the equation d = 70t1 to solve for d:
d = 70t1
d = 70[(90T - 200) / 50]
d = 126T - 280
We know that 2d = 70t1 + 90t2, so we can use this equation to check our answer:
2d = 70t1 + 90t2
2d = 70[(90T - 200) / 50] + 90[(10T + 200) / 50]

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of matches that the team lost. We know that the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. 
Action: 
The number of matches lost is 30% of the total number of matches played. 
Let's start by finding the total number of matches played. 
Total matches played = matches won + matches lost
Total matches played = 20 + [unknown]
We know that the team lost 30% of their matches. So, the number of matches lost is:
Matches lost = 30% of total matches played
Matches lost = 0.3(Total matches played)
We can substitute the expression for total matches played into the equation for matches lost:
Matches lost = 0.3(Total matches played)
Matches lost = 0.3(20 + [unknown])
Matches lost = 6 + 0.3([unknown])
We can simplify this equation by distributing the 0.3:
Matches lost = 6 + 0.3[unknown]
Matches lost = 6 + 0.3[unknown]
Now we can solve for the unknown variable by subtracting 6 from both sides:
Matches lost - 6 = 0.3[unknown]
0.3[unknown] = Matches lost - 6
Finally, we can divide both sides by 0.3 to solve for the unknown variable:
[unknown] = (Matches lost - 6) / 0.3
We don't know the exact number of matches lost, but we can see that the answer will be a multiple of 10. 
Let's try each answer choice to see which one gives us a result that makes sense:
A) Matches lost = 70 - 20 = 50
50 is not 30% of the total matches played (70), so this is not the correct answer.
B) Matches lost = 30% of total matches played = 0.3(20 + 50) = 0.3(70) = 21
This answer makes sense, so we will choose B.
C) Matches lost = 3 is not 30% of the total matches played (23), so this is not the correct answer.
D) Matches lost = 7 is not 30% of the total matches played (27), so this is not the correct answer.
E) Matches lost = 5 is not 30% of the total matches played (25), so this is not the correct answer.

When the train covers a quarter of the distance, the remaining distance is 3/4 of the total distance.
Let's calculate the distance covered by the train before it starts raining.
Distance covered by the train before it starts raining = 1/4 x 1000 = 250 miles

C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
","Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
","Thought:
Let's assume C joined after x months.
A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
The ratio of their investments is (40,000*12):(60,000*10):(120,000*(12-x)) = 4:3:9-3x.
Let's assume C's share is y.
Then, (375,000*y) = (4+3+9-3x)*375,000/16.
Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 23y - 69.
We know that y = 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.
Substituting y, we get 3x = 23(2) - 69 = -23.
Therefore, x = 23/3 months.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Assume that C was there in the business for x months
A:B:C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x
= 40*12 : 60*10 : 120x = 40 : 5*10 : 10x
=8 : 10 : 2x
= 4 : 5 : x
C's share = 375000*x/(9+x) = 150000
=> 375x/(9+x) = 150
=> 15x = 6(9+x)
=> 5x = 18 + 2x
=> 3x = 18
=> x = 18/3 = 6
It means C was there in the business for 6 months. Given that B joined the business
after 2 months. Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined

  E: 64 m
","Thought:
Given that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x m.
Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x+1) m.
Area of the rectangular piece = length x breadth
150 = (4x+1) x x
150 = 4x^2 + x
4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
Solving the quadratic equation, we get x = 5 m (breadth)
Length = 4x + 1 = 21 m
Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)
Perimeter = 2(21 + 5) = 52 m
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"") [The correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is 52 m.]","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
