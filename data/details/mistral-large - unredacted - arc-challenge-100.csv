After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought:
The main goal of the researchers is to strengthen their conclusions about the effectiveness of the new antibiotic in treating pneumonia.
Option A is not the best choice because testing the antibiotic on human volunteers is not necessarily the best way to strengthen the conclusions. It could be a part of the process, but it is not the only way to confirm the effectiveness of the antibiotic.
Option B is not the best choice because publishing the results in a medical journal does not necessarily strengthen the conclusions. It is important to share the findings with the scientific community, but it does not provide additional evidence or confirmation of the results.
Option C is the best choice because asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic provides additional evidence of its effectiveness in treating pneumonia and helps confirm the results of the initial testing.
Option D is not the best choice because testing the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria is not directly relevant to the researchers' goal of confirming its effectiveness in treating pneumonia.

Choices:
  A: Hydrogen in the cores of the stars is exhausted.
  B: Material accumulates from stars that have died.
  C: Elements in the stars such as iron undergo fusion.
  D: Cores of stars become twice as massive as the Sun.
","Choices:
  A: Hydrogen in the cores of the stars is exhausted.
  B: Material accumulates from stars that have died.
  C: Elements in the stars such as iron undergo fusion.
  D: Cores of stars become twice as massive as the Sun.
","Thought:
The formation of new stars occurs when a cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. As the cloud collapses, it begins to spin and form a disk of material around a central protostar. The protostar continues to gather material from the disk, eventually becoming hot and dense enough to initiate nuclear fusion, at which point it becomes a main sequence star.
The process described in choice B is the closest to the process of star formation, even though it is not the most accurate answer.

The Ohio state tree is the buckeye.
Inherited traits are passed down from parents to offspring through genes.
The change in leaf color during the autumn season is an inherited trait of the buckeye tree.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The new factor introduced to the environment is a predator.
The predator is likely to target the weaker and smaller sheep, which are the light wool sheep.
The larger and stronger sheep, which are the dark wool sheep, are more likely to survive and reproduce.
Therefore, the population of sheep with light wool is more likely to decrease first.

Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
","Choices:
  A: the addition of acids to create a ball of food
  B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides
  C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices
  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
","Thought:
The process of digestion involves both physical and chemical changes. Physical changes involve a change in physical properties, such as shape, size, or state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance. Chemical changes involve a change in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.

The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.

The mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, as electrons have negligible mass.
In this case, the atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons.
The mass of the atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.
The sum of 8 protons and 8 neutrons is 16.
