  D: Unless your company is doing its best in at least one thing, it cannot succeed in market competition.
","Based on the self-reflection, I can see that the key points are:
1) The paragraph uses strong language like ""have to"" to emphasize that being great in at least one area is a requirement, not just an advantage, for a new company. 
2) The examples form a hierarchy, showing that if you aren't the best in one factor, you must be the best in the next. This reinforces the necessity.
3) The focus is on initial success factors for a startup company entering the market, not ongoing competition for established companies.
4) Answer D correctly captures that a new company cannot succeed in entering the market competition unless it is the best in at least one key area.
The other answers miss or confuse some of these essential points.
Therefore, upon further reflection, I agree that D is the best answer.

  C: The degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious than in developing countries.
  D: Polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than in developed countries.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points from the economist's argument are:
1. Transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries benefits developed countries by improving their environment.
2. Developing countries are compensated for the pollution by increased employment and tax revenue. 
3. As a result, both sides benefit, increasing total global welfare.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not explicitly stated as an assumption. The argument does not compare the importance of the environment between developed and developing countries.
B) While this may be true, it is not a necessary assumption for the economist's argument. The argument is specifically about transferring industries from developed to developing countries.
C) The current pollution levels are not discussed. The argument is about the impact of transferring industries, not comparing current pollution.
D) This is the key implicit assumption. For the transfer to be mutually beneficial as argued, the polluting industries must be more profitable in developing countries (likely due to lower costs). This higher profitability enables the developing countries to be compensated sufficiently to offset the increased pollution.
Therefore, the hypothesis the economist is relying on is D - that the polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than developed countries. This is a necessary assumption for the conclusion that the transfer benefits both sides.

1. The two original statements are:
   - ""Money is like dung"" 
   - ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars""
2. If we treat these statements as premises and combine them, it could lead to the faulty conclusion ""Friends are like dung"". 
3. However, just because combining the statements in a certain way leads to a false conclusion, that doesn't necessarily mean either of the original statements are false on their own.
4. Statement A is incorrect, because ""Money is like dung"" being false doesn't logically follow from the absurd conclusion. The statement could still be true in a metaphorical sense.
5. Statement B is correct. If we assume friends are indeed worth a lot of money (as the second premise states), then logically money cannot be like dung, otherwise it would lead to the false conclusion. So the two premises are logically incompatible.
6. While ""friends are valuable"" may be a true statement, it doesn't directly address the logical issue in the argument that leads to the false conclusion. So C is not the best answer.
7. D is incorrect, because the truth values of the individual statements are not the core issue. The problem is with the logical implication when combining the statements.

3. If J participates, then G participates.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
The given opinion states that sand and dust storms in Inner Mongolia are natural disasters caused by climate drought, grassland degradation and desertification. It claims they are inevitable.
To question this opinion, we need to find evidence that the storms are not inevitable natural disasters, but rather caused by human factors.
Choice A: The fact that grass used to be much taller in the 1950s compared to now suggests that the degradation is not purely due to natural climate change, but likely influenced by human activity over time. This choice helps question the given opinion.
Choice B: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia versus the much healthier grasslands in neighboring Mongolia also points to human influence, since the regions likely experience similar natural climate conditions. This choice helps question the opinion too.
Choice C: The fact that grass along the uninhabited border maintains its 1950s height strongly suggests that the degradation elsewhere is due to human factors, not inevitable natural changes. This choice questions the opinion.
Choice D: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms. It does not help to question the opinion, but rather directly refutes it.

C) This seems to be restating the original quote in a slightly different way. It aligns with the meaning.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument states that some advertisers refused to renew contracts with the ""Inferno"" magazine after it started publishing violent and pornographic content. This shows the advertisers consider ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.
To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for why the advertisers didn't renew, other than ethical considerations.
A: If the violent/pornographic content is more moderate compared to similar magazines, this doesn't really explain why advertisers left. It could still be due to ethical objections.
B: Low credibility of such magazines could be another reason advertisers left, apart from ethics. This weakens the argument somewhat.
C: If the advertisers mainly promoted household goods, this could explain why they left - their products don't align with the new magazine content. This weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation.
D: Much higher advertising costs after the name change provides a clear economic reason for advertisers to leave, separate from any ethical considerations. This substantially weakens the argument.
Considering all the choices, D most directly weakens the argument by offering a strong alternative explanation. All the other choices still leave open the possibility that ethics played a key role in the advertisers' decisions.

  D: Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument is that the increase in seals caused the decline in crocodiles. But this is difficult to establish since seals rarely eat crocodiles directly.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) If seawater pollution damages crocodiles more than seals, that would provide an alternative explanation for the crocodile decline, weakening the seal-crocodile argument. This looks promising.
B) The relative numbers of seals and crocodiles doesn't really impact whether seals caused the crocodile decline. It's the trend that matters.
C) If crocodiles were already declining before seals increased, that suggests the seal increase didn't initiate the decline. But it doesn't rule out seals exacerbating the decline.
D) If crocodiles and seals compete for the same food source (capelin), then an increase in seals could reduce the food available for crocodiles, indirectly causing crocodile declines. This weakens the idea that seals couldn't impact crocodiles.
Considering the self-reflection keywords, I didn't fully consider species interactions and competition last time. Answer D points to resource competition as an indirect way seals could impact crocodiles, which substantially weakens the argument.

1. The question states that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy. 
2. It also states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can actually achieve a 20% productivity increase.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not necessarily true. The question only states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy. It does not say a 20% increase is required.
B) This logically follows from the information given. If a 10% increase avoids bankruptcy, and Green Island can actually achieve a 20% increase, then a 20% increase will certainly avoid bankruptcy.
C) The question does not provide any information about what happens if the market does not change. We cannot deduce this statement from the given information.
D) This directly contradicts the information given, which states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase is achievable.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the information provided is B.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument states that archaeologists believed hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave during the Neolithic Age, based on excavated artifacts like tools, pottery, etc. 
To refute this, we need to find a statement that directly contradicts or undermines the idea that people lived in the cave.
A) The cave inspiring descriptions of hell in Greek mythology doesn't refute people living there earlier.
B) The cave being an ancient cemetery and funeral venue could explain the artifacts without people living there. This weakens the argument but doesn't definitively refute it.
C) Whether or not earlier prehistoric villages have been found in Europe is not directly relevant to refuting if people lived in this specific cave.
D) If the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago, that would have been during the Neolithic period (roughly 10,000 BC to 3,000 BC). A collapsed entrance would have made it impossible for people to live in the cave after that point, directly contradicting the archaeologists' conclusion. This strongly refutes the argument.
Therefore, choice D is the best answer to refute the argument that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave, as a collapsed entrance would have prevented habitation.

1. The first statement says that for listed companies, only those with dividends can issue new stocks. 
2. The second statement says that if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.
3. The third statement says that if a company needs financing, there is no way for it to pay dividends.
From these statements, we can deduce:
- If a listed company needs financing, it cannot have dividends (from statement 3)

3. If X is in production, then W must also be in production (given condition 3).
4. So if X and F are in the same department (production), then F, X and W are all in production. That fills the 3 production slots.
5. H and Y must be together (condition 1), so they must be either in sales or public relations. 
6. Since there's only 1 public relations slot, H and Y must be in sales together.

B) While being the best could lead to making more money, the question stem doesn't directly imply that only the best companies make big money. There could be other factors.
C) The question stem doesn't mention profitability of industries. It's focused on what companies can do, not the industry landscape.
D) The question stem doesn't discuss what used to be good or bad for industries vs enterprises. It's about the shift in focus for enterprises themselves.

A) This supports the expert's view by highlighting the negative economic impact of the bridge limiting ship passage. It does not raise doubts.
B) This suggests that 99% of international ships don't even go past the Nanjing Bridge, and the ports above it rarely have large ships. If true, this would mean demolishing the bridge to allow large ship passage is not actually necessary, contradicting the expert. 
C) This just says there are other low bridges that also limit ships. It doesn't contradict the need to address the Nanjing Bridge specifically.
D) 8000-ton ships being able to pass through to Wuhan suggests the bridge is not actually preventing large ships as the expert claims. However, those ships are specially designed for the Yangtze, so it doesn't fully refute the expert's broader point about giant ships in general.

3. F and G cannot be in charge of the same department. H and I also cannot be in charge of the same department.

5. Since there is only one assistant (X) in charge of all 3 departments, and we know it can't be F (since F doesn't share a department with G or M), X must be either P, H, or I.

A) Severe investigations occurring doesn't explain the inconsistency. This fits with the expert view but doesn't address the survey finding.
B) If cities with strict enforcement still have drunk driving occurring, that could explain why their accident rates are similar to cities without enforcement. The enforcement may not be effective enough.
C) Driver awareness is a separate issue. Even if awareness is more important, it doesn't resolve the specific inconsistency about enforcement.
D) Stopping other violations is also a tangential point. The inconsistency is specifically about drunk driving enforcement.

  D: Among those who do not approve of college students being nanny, 40% believe that students should choose a field related to their major in practice.
","Choices:
  A: Among those who choose to ""will invite college students to be nanny"", 75% intend to let college students work as tutors or secretaries, and only 25% want college students to do housework.
  B: 62% of the people in the survey indicated that they were only willing to pay a monthly salary of 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan for the college nanny.
  C: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services.
  D: Among those who do not approve of college students being nanny, 40% believe that students should choose a field related to their major in practice.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key contradiction is that while 63% favor college students as nannies, nearly 60% say they would not actually hire a college student as a nanny. There must be some reason why people like the idea in theory but are unwilling to follow through in practice.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This doesn't explain the contradiction. It's about what duties people would assign, not why they wouldn't hire college students in the first place.
B: This could explain it. If people think the appropriate salary is only 800-1000 yuan per month, college students may be unwilling to work for that amount. So while people like the idea, the salary mismatch means it doesn't happen.
C: This also doesn't resolve the contradiction. It's about why people think being a nanny is good for the students, not why they wouldn't hire them.
D: This is also not directly relevant. It's about people who don't approve of the idea at all, not the people who like the idea but still wouldn't hire a college student.
Considering the implications, B provides the most logical explanation for the seeming contradiction in the survey results. If the salary people are willing to pay is too low, that could lead to the gap between favoring the concept but being unwilling to actually hire college students in practice.

Choice B questions how we can know others have similar experiences. This challenges the argument's assumption and is a reasonable doubt. Eliminated. 
Choice C claims mirages are real because visual experience is reliable. However, the argument never claimed all visual experiences are veridical - just that they generally indicate an external reality. Mirages being illusions is compatible with the argument. This is not a strong objection.
Choice D asks why natural science is so successful if it's not reflecting an external reality. This actually supports the original argument rather than challenging it. The success of science is presented as evidence for an external world.

Choice A is about the cost and price of the magazines. This is an economic factor, not an ethical one, so it doesn't strengthen the argument. 
Choice B says the advertisers weren't financially harmed by switching to other publications. This supports the idea they made the switch for ethical reasons, even at a potential economic cost. So this strengthens the argument.
Choice C is about reader preferences. While likely true, it doesn't directly relate to the advertisers' motivations. It doesn't strengthen the argument.
Choice D says some advertisers switched to ""Inferno"". This actually weakens the argument by suggesting advertisers just follow the audience. It doesn't show ethical considerations.

1) Posts about positive social issues like charity and bravery increased by 50% compared to 5 years ago
2) Posts about negative things like crime and violence increased by 90% compared to 5 years ago
The question asks which answer choice, if true, would most weaken this argument. Let's consider each choice:
A) This is just a general saying about how bad news spreads faster than good news. It doesn't directly address the argument or provide new information to weaken it.
B) If the number of total internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, that means there are far more people posting on online forums overall compared to 5 years ago. So the increases in both positive and negative posts could simply be due to the much larger user base, rather than reflecting real changes in social atmosphere. This significantly weakens the argument.
C) The existence of some people spreading online rumors for profit doesn't tell us anything about broader social trends or overall post percentages. It's not directly relevant.
D) The forum being legal has no bearing on whether the post percentages reflect real social changes. This point is irrelevant to evaluating the strength of the argument.
After analyzing all the choices, B provides the most relevant information to cast doubt on the argument's conclusion. The argument relies on percentage changes without accounting for the total number of users and posts, which B points out has drastically increased.

Choices:
  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
  B: Before? G In? K After? N
  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
","Choices:
  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
  B: Before? G In? K After? N
  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key information is that H is in Team 2. This triggers condition (6) - if H is in team 2, Q must be in the middle of team 1.
Now let's go through the answer choices one by one:
A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N
This satisfies condition (6) as Q is in the middle. It also satisfies (3) as L is in team 1. 
However, it violates (4) as N cannot be in the same team as Q. Eliminate A.
B: Before? G In? K After? N 
This violates (6) as Q is not in the middle of team 1. Eliminate B.
C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
This satisfies all relevant conditions - (6) as Q is in the middle, and (3) as L is in team 1.
Keep C as a possible answer.
D: Before? G Middle? K After? L
This violates (6) as Q is not in the middle of team 1. Eliminate D.
After eliminating the choices that violate the given conditions, we are left with only one possible answer.
