Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Choices:
  A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$
  B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$
  C: $\sqrt{3}$
  D: $3 \sqrt{3}$
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the advice and properties of exponents:
1) The general rule for fractional exponents is $a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$. 
2) In this case, we have $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$. So $a=9$, $m=3$, and $n=4$.
3) Applying the rule, we get:
   $9^{\frac{3}{4}} = (\sqrt[4]{9})^3 = (9^{\frac{1}{4}})^3$
4) Now, let's look at the answer choices:
   A: $\sqrt[3]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$, not $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
   B: $\sqrt[4]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$, which is part of the correct expansion of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, but not the complete answer.
   C: $\sqrt{3}$ is not related to the given expression.
   D: $3\sqrt{3}$ is also not related to the given expression.
5) None of the given answer choices correctly represent $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
Therefore, none of the provided choices are equivalent to $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Since 9 can be rewritten as $3^{2}, 9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is equivalent to $3^{2^{\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)}}$. Applying the properties of exponents, this can be written as $3^{\frac{3}{2}}$, which can further be rewritten as $3^{\frac{2}{2}}\left(3^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$, an expression that is equivalent to $3 \sqrt{3}$.Choices $A$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $9^{\frac{1}{4}}$. Choice $C$ is incorrect; it is equivalent to $3^{\frac{1}{2}}$.",N,D,0,535,377,912,

","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) We're given the equation $3x - y = 12$ and asked to find the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
2) Let's simplify $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. We can rewrite 8 as $2^3$:
   $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
3) Now, look at the exponent $3x-y$. This matches the left side of the given equation $3x - y = 12$.
4) Therefore, we can substitute 12 for $3x-y$ in the exponent:
   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
5) So, $\frac{8^x}{2^y} = 2^{12}$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. One approach is to express $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ so that the numerator and denominator are expressed with the same base. Since 2 and 8 are both powers of 2 , substituting $2^{3}$ for 8 in the numerator of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ gives $\frac{\left(2^{3}\right)^{x}}{2^{y}}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$. Since the numerator and denominator of $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$ have a common base, this expression can be rewritten as $2^{3 x-y}$. It is given that $3 x-y=12$, so one can substitute 12 for the exponent, $3 x-y$, given that the expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is equal to $2^{12}$. Choice B is incorrect. The expression $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{2^{3 x}}{2^{y}}$, or $2^{3 x-y}$. If the value of $2^{3 x-y}$ is $4^{4}$, which can be rewritten as 28 , then $2^{3 x-y}=2^{8}$, which results in $3 x-y=8$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. If the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ is $8^{2}$, then $2^{3 x-y}=8^{2}$, which results in $3 x-y=6$, not 12 . Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ can be determined.",A,A,1,498,259,757,

Assuming gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{25}{4} m=95$

  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$

  C: $\frac{4}{25} m=95$
  D: $\frac{4}{25} m=5$
","Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1. Understand the given information:
   * Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week
   * His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon
   * Gasoline costs $4 per gallon
   * Alan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $5
2. Define the variable:
   * Let $m$ be the number of miles Alan should drive less each week
3. Set up the equation:
   * Current cost of gasoline per week = $\frac{100 \text{ miles}}{25 \text{ miles/gallon}} \times \$4/\text{gallon} = \$16$
   * Desired cost of gasoline per week = Current cost - $5 = $16 - $5 = $11
   * Desired miles driven per week = 100 miles - $m$ miles
   * Equation: $\frac{100-m}{25} \times 4 = 11$
4. Solve the equation:
   * $\frac{100-m}{25} \times 4 = 11$
   * $\frac{4}{25}(100-m) = 11$
   * $\frac{4}{25}(100-m) = \frac{4}{25} \times 25$
   * $100-m = 25$
   * $-m = 25-100$
   * $-m = -75$
   * $m = 75$
5. Check the answer choices:
   * The equation $\frac{4}{25}m = 5$ matches our setup and solution
Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{4}{25}m = 5$
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Since gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, and since Alan's car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon, the expression $\frac{4}{25}$ gives the cost, in dollars per mile, to drive the car.Multiplying $\frac{4}{25}$ by $m$ gives the cost for Alan to drive $m$ miles in his car. Alan wants to reduce his weekly spending by $\$ 5$, so setting $\frac{4}{25} m$ equal to 5 gives the number of miles, $m$, by which he must reduce his driving.Choices $A, B$, and $C$ are incorrect. Choices $A$ and $B$ transpose the numerator and the denominator in the fraction. The fraction $\frac{25}{4}$ would result in the unit miles per dollar, but the question requires a unit of dollars per mile. Choices $A$ and $C$ set the expression equal to 95 instead of 5, a mistake that may result from a misconception that Alan wants to reduce his driving by 5 miles each week; instead, the question says he wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\$ 5$.",D,D,1,579,429,1008,
