| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| a | 0 |
| 3a | -a |
| 5a | -2a |

We can observe that the relationship between x and y is linear. We can write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b.

From the table, we can see that the slope (m) is -2, as the ratio of the change in y to the change in x is -2.

Now, let's check the given options:

A: x + 2y = a

This equation cannot be true for any value of a, as the sum of x and 2y is always zero.

B: x + 2y = 5a

This equation is true for a = 1, as x = 3a and y = -a satisfy the equation.

C: 2x - y = -5a

This equation is true for a = 1, as x = 5a and y = -2a satisfy the equation.

D: 2x - y = 7a

This equation cannot be true for any value of a, as the left-hand side is always positive, while the right-hand side is always negative.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: x + 2y = 5a.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.
Action: Answer(""C"") 

Explanation: 
The acceleration due to gravity on Uranus is 10.7 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Using the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on Uranus:
$W=m(10.7)$
$W=150(10.7)$
$W=1605$
The weight of the object on Uranus is approximately 1605 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on Uranus.","Choice B is correct. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$. Thus, for an object with a weight of 150 newtons, the formula $W=m g$ becomes $150=m(9.8)$, which shows that the mass of an object with a weight of 150 newtons on Earth is about 15.3 kilograms. Substituting this mass into the formula $W=m g$ and now using the weight of 170 newtons gives $170=15.3 g$, which shows that the second planet's acceleration due to gravity is about $11.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$. According to the table, this value for the acceleration due to gravity holds on Saturn.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. The quantity of the product supplied to the market is given by the function $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$. If the price $P$ of the product increases by $\$ 10$, the effect on the quantity of the product supplied can be determined by substituting $P+10$ for $P$ in the function $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$. This gives $S(P+10)=\frac{1}{2}(P+10)+40=\frac{1}{2} P+45$, which shows that $S(P+10)=S(P)+5$. Therefore, the quantity supplied to the market will increase by 5 units when the price of the product is increased by $\$ 10$.Alternatively, look at the coefficient of $P$ in the linear function $S$. This is the slope of the graph of the function, where $P$ is on the horizontal axis and $S(P)$ is on the vertical axis. Since the slope is $\frac{1}{2}$, for every increase of 1 in $P$, there will be an increase of $\frac{1}{2}$ in $S(P)$, and therefore, an increase of 10 in $P$ will yield an increase of 5 in $S(P)$.Choice $A$ is incorrect.

Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts.

We can start by expanding the given expression:

$(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$

Since $a+b=8$, we can substitute this into the expression above:

$a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

$a b = 15$
$2 b = c$

$a = 3$

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9x - \frac{2}{3} \cdot 6 - 4 = 9x - 6$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$6x - \frac{12}{3} - 4 = 9x - 6$$

Collecting like terms, we get:

$$6x - 12 - 4 = 9x - 6$$

Simplifying, we get:

Subtracting 9x from both sides, we get:

Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

We can solve the first equation for x:

x = (5x - 7) / 3
x = 5x/3 - 7/3
x = 5(x/3) - 7/3

Now, we can substitute the expression for x into the second equation:

3y/3 + c = 5y/3 - 7/3
3y + c = 5y - 7/3

","  Let's break this down step by step:

1. The total number of left-handed students is 18.
2. The total number of right-handed students is 122.
3. The number of right-handed female students is 5 times the number of left-handed female students.
4. The number of right-handed male students is 9 times the number of left-handed male students.

Now, let's use this information to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.

Let LF be the number of left-handed female students.
Let RF be the number of right-handed female students.
Let LM be the number of left-handed male students.
Let RM be the number of right-handed male students.

From the problem statement, we know that:

RF = 5LF
RM = 9LM

We also know that the total number of left-handed students is 18, so:

LF + LM = 18

Similarly, the total number of right-handed students is 122, so:

RF + RM = 122

Now, we can solve the system of equations. First, we can solve the second equation for LM:

LM = (122 - RF) / 9

Now, substitute this expression for LM into the first equation:

LF + (122 - RF) / 9 = 18

Multiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:

9LF + 122 - RF = 162

Now, solve for RF:

RF = 122 - 9LF

Now, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female:

Prob(right-handed student is female) = RF / (RF + RM)

Substituting the expression for RF, we get:

Prob(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9LF) / (122 - 9LF + RM)

Now, we can simplify this expression. The denominator is equal to the total number of right-handed students (122), so:

Prob(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9LF) / 122

Simplifying further, we get:

Prob(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 9LF / 122

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

Prob(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 9(18) / 122

Prob(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 162 / 122

Prob(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 1.33

Prob(right-handed student is female) = 0.357

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is correct. Let $x$ be the number of left-handed female students and let $y$ be the number of left-handed male students.

1. The researcher estimated that $23 \%$ of the students in the population see a movie at least once a month using a random sample of students from a large university.
2. The margin of error for this estimation is $4 \%$.

From this information, we can conclude that the true percentage of students who see a movie at least once a month could be up to $4 \%$ higher or lower than the estimated value of $23 \%$. This means the true percentage could be between $19 \%$ and $27 \%$.

We are given the equation h = 3a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.
To find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = 3.
Substituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = 3(2) + 28.6 = 3(3) + 28.6 = 100.8.
Substituting a = 3 into the equation, we get h = 3(3) + 28.6 = 108.6.
Now we can calculate the slope:
Slope = (108.6 - 100.8) / (3 - 2) = 7.8 / 1 = 7.8
The slope tells us that the boy's height increases by 7.8 inches each year.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is correct. In the equation $h=3 a+28.6$, if $a$, the age of the boy, increases by 1 , then $h$ becomes $h=3(a+1)+28.6=3 a+3+28.6=$ $(3 a+28.6)+3$.

x + y + z = 855

We know that x is 50% more than the sum of y and z, so we can write:

x = 1.5(y + z)

Substituting this expression for x into the first equation, we get:

1.5(y + z) + y + z = 855

Combine like terms:

2y + 2z = 855

Subtract z from both sides:

2y = 740

Divide both sides by 2:

y = 370

Now we can find z:

z = 855 - 2y

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

Now, let's consider the three options:

I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.

This statement is false. If the temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by $\frac{9}{5}$ degrees.

II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

This statement is true. We can see this by rearranging the equation:

If the temperature in Celsius increases by 1 degree, the temperature in Fahrenheit will increase by $\frac{9}{5}$ degrees, which is approximately 1.8 degrees.

III. A temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.

This statement is false. If the temperature increases by $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by less than 1 degree.

$ (x - 11)^2 = 25$
$x - 11 = ±√25$

Since both points of intersection have a $y$-coordinate of 25 , it follows that the two points are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$. Since these points lie on the horizontal line $y=25$, the distance between these points is the positive difference of the $x$-coordinates: $16-6=10$.Alternatively, since a translation is a rigid motion, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ would be the same as the distance between the points of intersection of the line $y=25$ and the parabola $y=x^{2}$.

","Choices:

  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
","  Let's call the original length and width of the rectangle $L$ and $W$, respectively.
The area of the original rectangle is $A = LW$.

After the alterations, the length is $L + 10\%$ of $L$ = $1.1L$ and the width is $W - p\%$ of $W$ = $0.9W$ (since $p$ is a percentage, we can write it as $0.9W$).

The area of the modified rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(0.9W) = 0.99LW$.

The question states that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99LW = 0.88A$

Now, we can solve for $p$. We know that $L$ and $W$ are positive, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $LW$ to get:

$0.99 = 0.88\frac{LW}{LW}$

$1 = 0.88\frac{L}{W}$

$W = 0.88L$

Now, we can substitute this expression for $W$ into the equation for the area of the modified rectangle:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88L) = 0.99L^2$

We know that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

Now, we can solve for $L$:

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

Now, we can substitute this expression for $L$ into the equation for $W$:

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}$

Now, we can find $p$ by substituting $W$ into the equation for $A'$:

$A' = (1.1L)(0.88\sqrt{\frac{A}{1.1}}) = 0.99L^2$

$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$

$L^2 = \frac{0.88A}{0.99}$

$L = \sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$W = 0.88L = 0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$

$p = \frac{W}{L} = \frac{0.88\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}}{\sqrt{\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}} = 0.88$

Therefore, the value of $p$ is $0.88$, which corresponds to choice $B$.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is incorrect because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease.
