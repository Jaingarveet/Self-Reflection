","Thought:
The original price of the computer can be found by first finding the discounted price before tax, and then dividing the total amount paid by the sum of the discount rate and tax rate.
The discount rate is 0.8 (1 - 0.20) and the tax rate is 1.08 (1 + 0.08).
The discounted price before tax is equal to the total amount paid divided by the tax rate, or p/1.08.
The original price of the computer is equal to the discounted price before tax divided by the discount rate, or (p/1.08)/0.8.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$. However, this is incorrect because $8 \%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites.

Therefore, -3 = -a/2.
Solving for a, we get a = 6.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively.

To solve this problem, I need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation gives $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, I can rewrite $a$ as $8-b$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation gives $8 b x^{2}-b^{2} x^{2}+56 x-7 b x+2 b x+14$.
Combining like terms gives $-b^{2} x^{2}+8 b x^{2}+49 x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, I can see that $-b^{2}+8 b=15$ and $49=c$.
Solving for $b$ gives $b=3$ or $b=5$.
Substituting these values back into $a+b=8$ gives $a=5$ or $a=3$, respectively.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are $3 \times 5+2 \times 7=21$ and $5 \times 3+2 \times 7=31$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

The mean is the average of all the values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the mean.
The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median since it is not the middle value.
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range since it is the highest value.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.
