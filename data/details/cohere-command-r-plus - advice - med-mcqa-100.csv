The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

Demographics and epidemiology: The patient is a 60-year-old male, and his gender and age should be considered in the diagnosis.

Symptoms: Right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge that is sometimes blood-tinged suggest a localized nasal cavity issue.

Biopsy image: The image shows a granulomatous inflammation with giant cells and a necrotic center. This pattern is characteristic of a specific type of granulomatous disease.

Differential diagnosis:
- Rhinoscleroma: A chronic bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, leading to rhinophyma (""pug nose""). Typically affects children and young adults in endemic areas, and is more common in developing countries.
- Wegener's granulomatosis: A rare autoimmune disease that affects small- and medium-sized blood vessels. It involves granulomatous inflammation and necrosis, typically affecting the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. However, it usually presents with more widespread symptoms, including fever, weight loss, and renal involvement.
- Midline lethal granuloma (MLG): A rare and aggressive form of granulomatous inflammation that typically affects the nose and paranasal sinuses. It often presents with nasal obstruction, discharge, and epistaxis. The biopsy image is highly suggestive of MLG due to its characteristic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. MLG mainly affects adults, and its prognosis is poor despite treatment.
- Rhinosporidiosis: A chronic infectious disease caused by the parasite Rhinosporidium seeberi. It typically affects the nasal mucosa and presents with polypoid masses and nasal discharge. It is endemic in certain parts of the world, particularly India, South America, and sub-Saharan Africa, and is usually transmitted through contaminated water.

Given the patient's age, gender, and biopsy findings, the correct diagnosis is C: Midline lethal granuloma (also known as Stewa's granuloma).
Action: Answer(""C"")","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals.

Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy.

","Reflection: I assumed that hydroxy acids were the only types of acids used in chemical peels and that all hydroxy acids could be used interchangeably in this context. I didn't consider that each acid has unique properties and indications.

Thought: 
Chemical peels are used to improve the appearance of the skin, commonly on the face, hands, and neck. Different types of acids are used as exfoliating agents, including alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), and phenol. 

Glycolic acid and lactic acid are common AHAs, while salicylic acid is a BHA. These acids have different molecular weights and penetration abilities, affecting the depth of the peel and the type of skin concerns they address. Kojic acid is also used in chemical peels and is known for its ability to improve pigmentation concerns. 

Phenol is a stronger agent used for deep chemical peels, treating more severe skin concerns. While glycolic acid, kojic acid, and salicylic acid are commonly used for mild to moderate peels, phenol is reserved for more intensive treatments due to its ability to penetrate deeper layers of the skin.

  D: easy to measure
","Reflection: I incorrectly chose answer choice ""A"" (pKa is equal to pH) in my previous attempt. However, upon reflection, I realized that while equal pKa and pH are necessary for effective buffering, it is the high concentration of bicarbonates in the blood that makes it an ideal buffer system. The combination of a weak acid and its conjugate base at equal concentrations results in a solution with a pH equal to its pKa. However, it is the abundant presence of bicarbonates that ensures the system can withstand significant pH changes without drastic shifts in blood pH.

Action: Answer(""B"")","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U.

","Reflection: Ovarian tumors can undergo torsion during pregnancy due to the increased mobility of the ovary caused by ligamentous relaxation and the enlarged size of the tumor.

","Reflection: Infection and hemorrhage are general risks of any surgical procedure, so they are less likely to be the correct answer for a question seeking a ""major complication"" of a specific surgery. Obstruction is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts, and is more of a complication associated with other procedures. Fistula formation is a known and significant risk due to the proximity of the stomach and pancreas, and the potential for an abnormal connection to form during the procedure.

","Reflection: I made an incorrect assumption that the vagus nerve was solely responsible for aspiration, when in fact, it has a more complex role in the aspiration reflex. The correct answer is C: SLN nerve. The Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) is a branch of the vagus nerve. It specifically controls the movements of the muscles in the larynx that are involved in swallowing and preventing food aspiration. An injury to this nerve could lead to aspiration issues without any change in voice, as the SLN has a more focused function compared to the vagus nerve, which has broader functions beyond just aspiration.

","Thought: 
The nephron is made up of the following parts: glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting duct.

The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs water, sodium, glucose, amino acids, and other nutrients.

The loop of Henle is responsible for creating a hypertonic environment in the medulla through water and ion absorption and secretion.

The distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, acid, and water and secretes potassium and hydrogen ions.

The collecting duct reabsorbs water and ions and is responsible for the final adjustment of water and ion balance before urine is excreted.

Therefore, the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is the principal site of urine acidification.
Action: Answer(""C"")","The cells of the proximal and distal tubules secrete hydrogen ions. Acidification also occurs in the collecting ducts.
