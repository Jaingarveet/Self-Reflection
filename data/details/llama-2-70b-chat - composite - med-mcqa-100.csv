Action: Answer(""B"")

The correct answer is B: UGI series.

Explanation:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition characterized by a narrowing of the pylorus, which can cause symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation. The imaging modality of choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis is a UGI (upper gastrointestinal) series. A UGI series is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the pylorus. It is the initial imaging modality of choice for pyloric stenosis and is effective in diagnosing the condition in most cases.

The other options are not the best choices for diagnosing pyloric stenosis:

* A: USG (ultrasound) is not the best choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis as it may not provide adequate visualization of the pylorus and may not be able to diagnose the condition accurately.
* C: CT (computed tomography) scan is a more invasive and expensive imaging modality that should be used when UGI is equivocal or when there are other indications for its use.
* D: MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is not commonly used for diagnosing pyloric stenosis as it may not provide adequate visualization of the pylorus and may not be able to diagnose the condition accurately.

","Choices:
  A: TOF
  B: VSD
  C: TAPVC
  D: TGA
","  Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
The chest X-ray image shows a large, dilated heart with a reversed aortic arch, which is consistent with Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA). This is a congenital heart defect where the aorta and pulmonary artery are reversed, causing the aorta to arise from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery to arise from the left ventricle. This results in deoxygenated blood being pumped to the body and oxygenated blood being pumped to the lungs, leading to heart failure.

The other choices, Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC), Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), and Truncus Arteriosus (TA), do not match the symptoms and chest X-ray image. TAPVC is a condition where the pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium instead of the left atrium, but it does not cause a reversed aortic arch. VSD is a hole in the wall between the ventricles, but it does not cause a reversed aortic arch either. TA is a rare congenital heart defect where a single artery arises from the heart instead of separate pulmonary and systemic arteries, but it is not associated with a reversed aortic arch.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA), which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and chest X-ray image.",d.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority.

Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986.

Bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood because they have a high concentration. This allows them to effectively react with excess hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH-) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3-), respectively, and maintain pH homeostasis in the body.

Instructions:

1. Identify the correct reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.
2. Recall that bicarbonate buffers have a high concentration in blood.
3. Understand that this high concentration allows bicarbonate buffers to effectively maintain pH homeostasis in the body.

Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of recurrent aspirations and no change in voice suggest that the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) is injured. The SLN is responsible for the movement of the larynx and vocal cord function, and damage to this nerve can cause aspiration and swallowing difficulties without affecting voice, as it primarily innervates the larynx. The patient's voice is not affected, indicating that the vagus nerve, which is responsible for voice production, is not damaged. Therefore, the answer is C: SLN nerve.

Solution:

1. Review the patient's symptoms and identify the key information that the patient has recurrent aspirations.
2. Recognize that the patient's voice is not affected, which indicates that the vagus nerve, which is responsible for voice production, is not damaged.
3. Understand that the glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for the sensation of swallowing and throat sensation, but it does not control the movement of the larynx or vocal cords.
4. Identify the superior laryngeal nerve as the nerve responsible for the movement of the larynx and vocal cord function.
5. Realize that damage to the SLN can cause aspiration and swallowing difficulties without affecting voice, as it primarily innervates the larynx.

Explanation:
After reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the term ""blood discharge"" and thought it referred to a malignancy. I was not familiar with the term ""duct papilloma"" and its association with nipple discharge. To avoid this mistake, I reviewed the different types of breast tumors and their symptoms, familiarized myself with the term ""duct papilloma"" and its association with nipple discharge, and understood the difference between benign and malignant tumors. Now, I know that duct papilloma is a benign tumor that originates in the lactiferous ducts of the breast and can cause nipple discharge. Therefore, the commonest cause of blood discharge from the nipple is duct papilloma.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the terminology used.
- Familiarize yourself with different types of breast tumors and their symptoms.
- Don't assume that all nipple discharge is due to malignancy.

Explanation:
The intracranial part of the internal carotid artery gives off several branches, including the anterior communicating, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, and posterior communicating arteries.
The correct answer is D, Posterior communicating, as it is not a branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery.

The posterior communicating artery is a branch of the posterior cerebral artery, not the internal carotid artery.
Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

The other options, A, B, and C, are all branches of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery and are therefore incorrect.

It is important to have a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the intracranial blood vessels, including the branches of the internal carotid artery, to answer questions like this correctly.

In summary, the correct answer is D, Posterior communicating, as it is not a branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery.","(Anterior communicating) (103- BDC-3, 4th edition, 750 Snell 8th)Branches of the Internal Carotid Artery* There are no branches in the neck** (Cervical), Many important branches, however are given off in the skull* Cerebral part branches(i) Opthalmic(ii) Anterior cerebral(iii) Posterior communicting(iv) Middle cerebral(v) Anterior choroidal* Of these the opthalmic artery supplies structures in the orbit while the others supply the brain",D,A,0,801,254,1055,

Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
Selegiline is an anti-Parkinson drug that acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity. It is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, which means it blocks the breakdown of dopamine in the brain. This results in an increase in dopamine levels, which helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

The other options do not accurately describe Selegiline's mechanism of action:

A: Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, which increases dopamine levels. It does not affect cholinergic activity.

B: Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, which means it blocks the conversion of levodopa into dopamine in the peripheral nervous system. This allows more levodopa to reach the brain, where it can be converted into dopamine. It does not affect cholinergic activity.

D: Biperiden is an anticholinergic drug that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that opposes dopamine. It is used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It does not increase dopamine levels or decrease cholinergic activity.
