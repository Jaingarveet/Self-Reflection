  C: In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes.
  D: The online forum is a legal forum
","Thought:
We need to find an option that explains the increase in posts about both positive and negative social issues, thus weakening the claim of a deteriorating social atmosphere.
Analysis of Choices:
*   A: This is a general statement about the nature of information spread and doesn't directly address the increase in posts.
*   B: **This is the most likely answer.** A quadrupling of internet users would naturally lead to a significant increase in all types of posts, not necessarily indicating a worsening social atmosphere. 
*   C: This option only addresses the potential increase in negative posts (rumors) and doesn't explain the rise in positive posts.
*   D: The legality of the forum doesn't impact the interpretation of the statistical comparison.

Therefore, the only remaining option with Q in the middle and without violating any conditions is A.
