The two passages are discussing the issue of slavery and its impact on the Union. Passage 1 is criticizing Lincoln for saying that the Union cannot stand divided into Free and Slave States, while Passage 2 is Lincoln defending his position that a house divided against itself cannot stand.

Choice C identifies a central tension between the two passages, as Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

Experiments blocking nerve fibers supported this notion. Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock.

The passage states that Volkov and his colleagues used electrodes to apply electrical current to the Venus flytrap and observed its response. They also determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. This indicates that they made the most extensive use of information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The second sentence of the last paragraph says that the focus of Volkov's work was the role of electricity in the Venus flytrap's closing mechanism. The paragraph goes on to explain that by applying electricity directly to the plant and ""altering the amount of electrical current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close."" It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple ""published theories"" or ""earlier models""; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model.",C,C,1,1306,82,1388,

The birds were observed using their wings and legs cooperatively to run up the side of the hay bales, which Ken called wing-assisted incline running (WAIR). This observation led to a series of experiments to study WAIR in more detail.

The passage mentions that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe. Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred that it was because they were easily accessible for him and his team to track and observe as part of the existing project to reintroduce them to Europe.

The reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is clearly stated at the beginning of the third paragraph: ""The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremit(A)to Europe."" Because the project reintroducing those birds was already underway, it was therefore easy for Usherwood and his team to join it.Choice A is incorrect because it would not be accurate to say that ibises were well acquainted with their migration route, as the third paragraph explains that scientists needed to ""show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route."" Choice B is incorrect because the third paragraph states that the ibises wore ""data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab"" but never indicates that they had worn any such device before or undertaken migration previously.

This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66). Her central claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral rights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there should be equal opportunities for men and women to advance and succeed.",A,A,1,1390,73,1463,

","Thought:
Passage 2 suggests that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories presented in Passage 1 because it goes against the principle of self-government and would lead to perpetual hatred from the islanders.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

The passage describes a visit to a shop that sells inksticks and ink cakes made by the narrator's family. The narrator's father is shown to be an expert in the qualities of ink and is able to describe the benefits of using their family's ink in a persuasive way. The passage also describes the narrator's memories of their Precious Auntie, who taught them about the importance of effort and intention in creating good ink.

The main theme of the passage is that quality is achieved through deliberate effort. This is shown through the description of the process of making ink and the emphasis on the importance of taking the time to push an inkstick along an inkstone to cleanse one's mind and heart. The passage also highlights the value of using high-quality materials and the benefits of using ink that has been made with care and intention.

The relationship between the two passages is that Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.

In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 .

The passage describes Sempere as a bookseller who gives the narrator a copy of ""Great Expectations"" by Charles Dickens. Sempere refers to Dickens as a ""lifelong friend"" and handles the book with care, suggesting that he has a deep appreciation for Dickens's work. However, there is no indication that Sempere models his own writing after Dickens's style, feels a personal connection to details of Dickens's biography, or considers himself to be Dickens's most appreciative reader.

As the reader can reasonably assume that Sempere doesn't actually know Dickens, this description can be read as signaling Sempere as an avid admirer of Dickens's work.Choice A is incorrect because the passage describes Sempere as a bookseller, not a writer. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because although the passage implies Sempere feels an emotional connection to Dickens, it doesn't suggest that this connection arises from any similarity between Sempere's life and that of Dickens.

Passage 1 is by Tocqueville and he believes that the sexes have distinct roles and duties in society, and that they should fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
Passage 2 is by Mill and he believes that individuals should have complete liberty of choice to pursue any occupation they are capable of, regardless of their sex or class.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1407,85,1492,

The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close because a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the required level of calcium concentration to close the trap. The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger, pushing the total concentration of calcium over the threshold needed to close the trap.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. Woolf argues that the ""bridge over the River Thames, [has] an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey"" (lines 1-3). The phrase ""make a survey"" means to carefully examine an event or activity. Woolf wants educated women to ""fix [their] eyes upon the procession - the procession of the sons of educated men"" (lines 9-11) walking to work.Choice $A$ is incorrect because while Woolf states the bridge ""is a place to stand on by the hour dreaming,"" she states that she is using the bridge ""to consider the facts"" (lines 6-9).

It can be inferred that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey's comment about the Georgia heat with resentment because they feel that she is minimizing their discomfort.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. In the first paragraph, Miss Spivey remarks that the heat in Georgia is nothing compared to the heat she experienced in Timbuktu. Later in this paragraph the narrator states, ""I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else."" Hence it can reasonably be inferred from the passage that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey's comment about the Georgia heat with resentment because they feel that she is minimizing their discomfort.Choice A is incorrect because Miss Spivey informs the people at the train station that she has experienced even more extreme heat, so they wouldn't have assumed that she is experiencing intense heat for the first time. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that the people at the station know Miss Spivey is coming to Threestep to work, not that they doubt she will stay there very long.

The passage states that Volkov's experiment successfully demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, which supports Hodick and Sievers's model. However, the passage also mentions that Volkov did not measure calcium levels, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","Thought:
The passage explains that the Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to close its trap, which is a mechanism to conserve energy. If the insect touches just one hair, the trap will not spring shut, and if a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair. This prevents the plant from wasting energy on small insects that are not worth the effort.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1271,110,1381,

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","Thought:
Passage 1 presents the concept of liberty as something that the United States should spread to other regions, such as Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippines, and Cuba, through the establishment of American laws and government. This is evident in lines 26-35, where Beveridge talks about Americans pouring into these regions and building civilization.

Passage 2, on the other hand, warns that the United States' principle of self-government would be weakened if it were to engage in imperialism and conquest of other regions, such as the Philippines. This is evident in lines 84-85, where Bryan states that ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here.""

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",B,B,1,1401,171,1572,
