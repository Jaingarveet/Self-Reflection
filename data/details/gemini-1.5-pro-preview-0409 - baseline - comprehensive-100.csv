","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x

","Thought:
First, we need to find the speed of the space shuttle. Speed is distance/time, so 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s.
Next, we know it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, which means the length of the space shuttle is the distance it travels in those 5 seconds.
Therefore, the length is speed * time = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5m. 
Since 87.5m is not an option, we choose the closest value, which is 75m.

","Let the length of the space shuttle be x metres and its speed be y m/sec. Then, x / y = 1 ⇒ y = x / 5

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.
Comparing coefficients, we have $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
Since $a + b = 8$, we can express $b$ as $8 - a$.
Substituting this into $ab = 15$, we get $a(8 - a) = 15$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$.
Factoring the quadratic, we get $(a - 3)(a - 5) = 0$.
Therefore, the possible values for $a$ are 3 and 5.
If $a = 3$, then $b = 5$ and $c = 7(3) + 2(5) = 31$.
If $a = 5$, then $b = 3$ and $c = 7(5) + 2(3) = 41$.
Action: Answer(""D"") 
","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9.

","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Multiplying each side of the equation $2 x-3 y=-14$ by 3 gives $6 x-9 y=-42$. Multiplying each side of the equation $3 x-2 y=-6$ by 2 gives $6 x-4 y=-12$. Then, subtracting the sides of $6 x-4 y=-12$ from the corresponding sides of $6 x-9 y=-42$ gives $-5 y=-30$. Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is $2-6=-4$.Alternatively, adding the corresponding sides of $2 x-3 y=-14$ and $3 x-2 y=-6$ gives $5 x-5 y=-20$, from which it follows that $x-y=-4$.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are incorrect and may be the result of an arithmetic error when solving the system of equations.

From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \%$ and the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$. If the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?
Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000
","Choices:
  A: 60,000
  B: 90,000
  C: 160,000
  D: 240,000
","Thought:
Let $x$ be the population of City X in 2010 and $y$ be the population of City Y in 2010. 
We know that $x = 120,000$ and that in 2015, the populations were equal. 
So, $1.2x = 0.9y$. 
Substituting the value of $x$, we get $1.2(120,000) = 0.9y$. 
Solving for $y$, we get $y = 160,000$.
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. It's given that the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, and that it increased by $20 \%$ from 2010 to 2015 . Therefore, the population of City X in 2015 was $120,000(1+0.20)=144,000$. It's also given that the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$ from 2010 to 2015. If $y$ represents the population of City $Y$ in 2010, then $y(1-0.10)=144,000$. Solving this equation for $y$ yields $y=\frac{144,000}{1-0.10}$. Simplifying the denominator yields $\frac{144,000}{0.90}$, or 160,000 .Choice $A$ is incorrect. If the population of City $Y$ in 2010 was 60,000 , then the population of City $Y$ in 2015 would have been $60,000(0.90)=54,000$, which is not equal to the City $\mathrm{X}$ population in 2015 of 144,000 . Choice B is incorrect because $90,000(0.90)=81,000$, which is not equal to the City X population in 2015 of 144,000. Choice D is incorrect because $240,000(0.90)=216,000$, which is not equal to the City X population in 2015 of 144,000.",C,C,1,387,144,531,

","Ans. is 'a' i.e., Primary structure The term denaturation refers to disruption of higher order (secondary, teiary and quaternary) structure of protein.All non-covalent bonds that maintain higher order structure are disrupted, but peptide bond (covalent bond) remains intact. Thus, the primary structure is not altered during denaturation, i.e., amino acid sequence is not altered, but denaturation may completely disrupt secondary, teiary and quaternary structure, e.g., denaturated oligomeric proteins dissociated into subunits, each with a randam coil formation.Denaturation is always accompanied by a loss of biological function, e.g., enzymes are inactivated and antibodies fail to act with antigens.Denaturation is generally irreversible, e.g., boiled egg does not regain its original form when kept in cold.Denatured proteins are less soluble and in many cases they precipitate.",A,A,1,276,30,306,

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia. Physical examination reveals a large mass on the lateral side of the scrotum, which can be transilluminated.

Choices:
  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia
","Choices:
  A: Adenocarcinoma
  B: Embryonal carcinoma
  C: Infertility
  D: Nodular prostatic hyperplasia
","Thought:
The key features here are:
* Scrotal mass
* Transillumination 
* Dilated blood vessels draining the testicle
These features are suggestive of a varicocele, which is a dilation of veins in the pampiniform plexus of the spermatic cord. 
Varicoceles are associated with:
* **Infertility**: due to impaired spermatogenesis from increased blood flow and temperature.
The other options are not directly related:
* Adenocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma are types of testicular cancer, not typically associated with varicocele.
* Nodular prostatic hyperplasia is unrelated to scrotal pathology. 
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Varicocele is considered a common cause of male infertility and oligospermia, although it is not clear why the dilation of veins should have such consequences. Testicular atrophy is found only rarely and only in long-standing disease. Surgical resection of varicocele by ligation of the internal spermatic vein often improves reproductive function. Varicocele is not associated with neoplasia (choices A, B, and E) or prostatic hyperplasia (choice D).Diagnosis: Varicocele",C,C,1,353,143,496,
