","Reflection:
I misread the question and did not pay enough attention to the answer choices. I also misinterpreted the passages. 
Thought:
Tocqueville believes that men and women have different roles in society, while Mill believes that everyone should have equal opportunities regardless of their sex. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1376,64,1440,

  D: tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood to an analysis of the effects of those hardships.
","Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly.
The passage starts with the narrator's love of reading and how he learned to read and write before other children.
The focus then shifts to the narrator's father's disapproval of books and his plan to send the narrator to work.
The main focus then shifts to the narrator's love for the Sempere & Sons bookshop and his discovery of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations.""
The passage ends with the narrator's desire to learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer.

Solution:
Action: Answer(""C"") - question a suggestion.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage.

Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.
