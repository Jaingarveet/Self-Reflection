Given that J is the fourth speaker, and F speaks in the first or third place, F cannot be the third speaker because it would mean that F speaks after lunch, which contradicts the given condition that three speakers speak before lunch and the other three speak after lunch. Therefore, F must be the first speaker. 
Since G must speak before lunch, G must be the second speaker. 
The third speaker cannot be J, L, or N because J is the fourth speaker, and there is only one speaker between M and N. If N were the third speaker, M would have to be the fifth speaker, which would mean that there are two speakers between M and N, not one.

The Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department, which means the Administration Department is either at the same level or above the Human Resources Department. Given that the Administration Department is above the Planning Department but below the Human Resources Department, the Administration Department cannot be above the Human Resources Department. Therefore, the Administration Department and the Human Resources Department must be on the same floor. This means the Sales Department, which cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department, cannot be one level above the Administration Department.
