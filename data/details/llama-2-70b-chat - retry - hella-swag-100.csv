The correct answer is B. The step suggests that you should jot down the information to work through later, so that you don't end up feeling bitter or resentful.

The correct answer is option C: ""When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.""

The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text, which means we need to find the best option that continues the train of thought of the given text.

The text suggests that we can find a promotional bonus code to get free minutes on prepaid phones. Option C continues this line of thinking by suggesting that we search online for promo codes specific to our prepaid phone service provider. This makes sense because promo codes are often released by service providers to promote their services, and searching online is a reasonable way to find them.

Option A is not relevant to the context, and option B is not a feasible way to find promo codes. Option D is absurd and not related to the topic.

D: This choice doesn't make sense. The sentence doesn't mention the young man striking the white ball, and it's unclear why he would stop the ball with the cue stick immediately after striking it.
