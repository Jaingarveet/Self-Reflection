","Thought: 
The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If the line passes through the origin, then the y-intercept must be zero. This means that when x=0, y must also be 0. 
We can set up the equation of the line using the slope and one of the points, (2, k), and then set y=0 and solve for x:
0 = [(32-k)/(k-2)]*(0-2) + k
0 = -2*(32-k)/(k-2) + k
0 = -64 + 2k + k(k-2)
0 = k^2 - 66k + 64
Solving this quadratic equation for k, we find that k = 2 or k = 32. However, k cannot be 2 because the denominator of the slope would be zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the only possible value for k is 32.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

  B: $x+2 y=5 a$

  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
","Thought: 
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, we can take the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a). The slope m = (-a - 0) / (3a - a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x = a, which is 0.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2x + 0. 
We can rearrange this to the form of the answer choices: 2x + y = 0.
However, we need to express the equation in terms of 'a', so we multiply the entire equation by 'a' to get: 2ax + ay = 0, which simplifies to x + 2y = 0, or in terms of 'a', x + 2y = a.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites. Adding the left- and right-hand sides of the equations $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ produces $7.2 x+0.0 y=-3.6$, which is equivalent to $7.2 x=-3.6$.

The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left side must equal the coefficients on the right side.
Therefore, $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
We also know that $a + b = 8$.
We can solve for a and b using the equations $ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$.
The solutions are $(a, b) = (5, 3)$ or $(a, b) = (3, 5)$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 41$ or $c = 31$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.
