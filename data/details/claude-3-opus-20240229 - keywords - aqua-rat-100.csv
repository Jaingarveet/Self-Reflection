","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) If Amy uses single letters only, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code the 10 types of books. 
2) However, Amy can also use pairs of letters. The key realization is that the order doesn't matter in these pairs. This means she's dealing with combinations, not permutations.
3) With n letters, the number of unique pairs (combinations) is given by the formula:
   
   $\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$
4) Let's start with the smallest possible n and see if it's enough:
   For n = 3: 
   Single letters: 3
   Pairs: $\binom{3}{2} = \frac{3*2}{2} = 3$
   Total: 3 + 3 = 6 (not enough)
   For n = 4:
   Single letters: 4  
   Pairs: $\binom{4}{2} = \frac{4*3}{2} = 6$
   Total: 4 + 6 = 10 (just enough!)
5) Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.
Action: Answer(""B"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. This information is about the vertical speed and distance, but is not directly relevant for finding the length.
2. The key information is that it takes the shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point at maximum speed. This means if we can find the horizontal speed, we can calculate the length.
3. However, the problem does not directly give the horizontal speed. I made an incorrect assumption before that the vertical and horizontal speeds were the same. That's not necessarily true.
4. Without knowing the horizontal speed or more information relating the vertical and horizontal motion, there is not enough information to calculate the length of the shuttle.
5. The height it reaches and time to reach that height vertically do not on their own allow determining the horizontal speed or length, without additional assumptions.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:
1) The company produces 420 components per month. Over a year that is:
   420 * 12 = 5040 components per year
2) The production cost is $110 per component. So the total yearly production cost is: 
   5040 * $110 = $554,400
3) They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. 
   Profit = Revenue - Costs
   So the total revenue must be at least:
   $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800
   
4) To get the minimum price per component, divide the total revenue by the number of components:
   $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29 per component

  E: None of these
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.
2) Then, tan(45°) = h/x. We know tan(45°) = 1, so h = x.
3) After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60°. Let the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes be d. 
   Then, tan(60°) = h/(x-d). We know tan(60°) = √3, so √3 = h/(x-d).
4) Substituting h = x from step 2:
   √3 = x/(x-d)
   √3(x-d) = x
   √3x - √3d = x
   √3x - x = √3d
   x(√3 - 1) = √3d
   
5) Solving for d:
   d = x(√3 - 1)/√3 
     = x(√3/√3 - 1/√3)
     = x(1 - 1/√3)
     
6) Now, if the speed of the car is v, then x = 10v (since the car traveled distance x in 10 minutes).
7) The remaining distance to the tower is x - d. At speed v, this will take time (x - d)/v.
8) Substituting x = 10v and the expression for d from step 5:
   Time = (10v - 10v(1 - 1/√3))/v
        = 10 - 10(1 - 1/√3)
        = 10 - 10 + 10/√3
        = 10/√3
        
9) Simplifying:
   Time = 10/√3 * √3/√3
        = 10√3/3
        = 10√3/3 * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)
        = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3(√3 + 1))
        = (10(3 + √3))/(3(√3 + 1))
        = (10/3) * (3 + √3)/(√3 + 1)
        = (10/3) * (√3 + 1)
        
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in (10/3) * (√3 + 1) minutes more.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

   We're given P(A) = 0.56 and P(B) = 0.74.
2) We want to find the probability that neither stock increases. Call this event ""N"". 
   So we're looking for the maximum possible value of P(N).
3) If the stocks were independent, then P(N) would simply be:
   P(N) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) 
        = (1 - 0.56) * (1 - 0.74)
        = 0.44 * 0.26 
        = 0.1144
4) However, the problem does not state the stocks are independent. If they are dependent, P(N) could be higher.
5) The maximum possible value for P(N) is the smaller of (1 - P(A)) and (1 - P(B)). 
   This would occur if the stocks were perfectly correlated - i.e. Stock B increases if and only if Stock A increases.
6) 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
   1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. So the area of the full square is:
   Area of square = 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2
2. Two semicircles are cut out from opposite sides. The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm (the side length of the square). 
   To find the area of a semicircle, we use the formula:
   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * pi * r^2
   Here the radius r is half the diameter, so r = 20/2 = 10 cm.
   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * pi * 10^2 = 50pi cm^2
3. There are two semicircles cut out, so the total area removed is:
   Area removed = 2 * 50pi cm^2 = 100pi cm^2
4. The remaining area is the original square area minus the area removed:
   Remaining area = 400 cm^2 - 100pi cm^2

   - Let x be Sachin's total runs before the final
2. We know Sachin's batting average before the final is 51. Batting average is total runs divided by number of matches. So:
   51 = x/n
3. After the final, his batting average is 54. He scored 78 runs in the final. So now:
   54 = (x + 78)/(n + 1)
4. We can solve this system of equations for n. First, from the first equation:
   x = 51n
5. Substituting this into the second equation:
   54 = (51n + 78)/(n + 1)
6. Multiply both sides by (n+1):
   54(n+1) = 51n + 78
7. Expand the left side:
   54n + 54 = 51n + 78
8. Subtract 51n from both sides:
   3n + 54 = 78
9. Subtract 54 from both sides:
   3n = 24

   x * (1/2) inches
2) There are x-1 spaces between the pickets, since the number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets. Each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is:

3) The total length of the fence is the sum of the width of the pickets and the width of the spaces:
   Total length = x * (1/2) + (x-1) * 6 inches

1. Alloy X has a zinc to copper ratio of 6:9. This means in 15 parts of alloy X, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper.
2. Similarly, alloy Y has a zinc to copper ratio of 7:11. So in 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper.
3. We have 40 grams of alloy X. Since the ratio is 6:9, this means:
   - Zinc in alloy X = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
   - Copper in alloy X = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams
4. We have 60 grams of alloy Y. With the ratio 7:11, this means:
   - Zinc in alloy Y = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams
   - Copper in alloy Y = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams
5. In the new alloy Z, we have:
   - Total zinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time.
Given:
- If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. 
- If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
Let's define variables:
Let x = Arjun's money
Let y = Sajal's money
From the first condition:
y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
y + 30 = 2x - 60
y = 2x - 90 ... (1)
From the second condition: 
x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
x + 10 = 3y - 30
x = 3y - 40 ... (2)
Substituting (1) into (2):
x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
x = 6x - 270 - 40
x = 6x - 310
-5x = -310
x = 62
Substituting x = 62 into (1):
y = 2(62) - 90
y = 124 - 90
y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Suppose Arun has $X and Sajal has $Y. then,
2(x-30)= y+30 => 2x-y =90 …(i)

Solving (i) and (ii), we get x =62 and y =34.
Arun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. Let's call the speed of the current x kmph.
2. When rowing against the current, the man's speed is reduced by the current. So:

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
* The team won 20 matches
* They lost 30% of their total matches
* To find the number of matches lost, we first need to calculate the total number of matches played
* If we let x = total matches played, then:
   - x - 20 = matches lost
   - matches lost / total matches = 30% = 0.30
* So we can set up the equation:
   (x - 20) / x = 0.30
* Solving for x:
   x - 20 = 0.30x
   0.70x = 20
   x = 20/0.70 = 28.57
* The team played about 29 total matches (rounding 28.57 up since you can't play a fraction of a match)

1) Let's define some variables:
   Let p = amount of falafel in 1 pita bread
   Let r = amount of falafel in 1 roll
   Let b = amount of falafel in 1 baguette
2) From the given information, we can set up these equations:
   6p = 2r (six pita breads have the same amount of falafel as two rolls)
   3r = 5b (three rolls have the same amount of falafel as five baguettes)
3) From the first equation, we can express r in terms of p:
   6p = 2r
   r = 3p
4) Substituting this into the second equation:
   3(3p) = 5b
   9p = 5b
5) Now we can express b in terms of p:
   b = (9/5)p
6) The question asks: two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
   In other words, we need to find the value of x in this equation:
   2b = xp
7) Substituting the expression for b:
   2((9/5)p) = xp
   (18/5)p = xp
8) Solving for x:
   x = 18/5
   x = 3.6
9) But x must be a whole number since we're talking about a number of pita breads. The closest whole number is 3.
10) Let's verify this: 
    2 baguettes = 2(9/5) pita breads = 18/5 pita breads
    18/5 pita breads is closer to 3 pita breads than to 2 pita breads.

1. The question states there are more than 501 students. So the minimum number of students will be the smallest number greater than 501 that satisfies the other constraints.
2. 20% of the students took physics, and 28% took math. Importantly, it specifies ""exactly"", meaning there is no overlap between these groups. So in total, 20% + 28% = 48% of the students took either physics or math.
3. Since we're looking for the minimum number of students, let's assume the remaining 52% of students took neither physics nor math. This maximizes the overlap and minimizes the total number of students needed.
4. Now, the number of students must be divisible by 100 (so the percentages work out to whole numbers), and also by 25 (since 20% and 28% must be whole numbers). The least common multiple of 100 and 25 is 100.

2) When n = 36:
   x = (36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)
     = (1296 + 2*6*40 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)

Given:

Step 1: Let's represent the 5 consecutive odd numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8, where n is the first odd number in the sequence.
Step 2: The sum of these numbers is:
n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20
Step 3: According to the question, (5n + 20) ÷ 10 should be a perfect square.
Simplifying, we get: (n + 4) ÷ 2 = a perfect square
Step 4: For (n + 4) ÷ 2 to be a perfect square, (n + 4) must be an even number and divisible by 2.
