","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately reflect the central tension between the two passages.

The correct answer is choice C: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position. In Passage 1, Douglas accuses Lincoln of violating the law of God by criticizing the Constitution, while in Passage 2, Lincoln argues that Douglas misinterprets his position by claiming that he seeks to abolish the Constitution. This central tension between the two passages highlights the disagreement between Douglas and Lincoln on the issue of slavery and the Constitution.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",C,C,1,1396,201,1597,

""I believe the intended goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the relationship between body hair and CT fiber function. The experiment used microneurography to measure the activity of slow fibers in hairy skin, which suggested that these fibers were conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers. However, I now realize that the experiment's primary goal was likely to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey. The experiment used gentle brushing to stimulate CT fibers and recorded the nerve signals to determine the speed at which they fired. This information confirmed that CT fibers respond only to a narrow range of subtle stimuli and convey a different aspect of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.

To calculate the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder (CCD) that were infected by all four pathogens, we need to add the percent of colonies infected by each of the four pathogens together. According to the table, 83 percent of colonies with CCD were infected by IAPV, 77 percent were infected by KBV, 90 percent were infected by Nosema apis, and 48 percent were infected by Nosema ceranae. Therefore, the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by all four pathogens is: 83 + 77 + 90 + 48 = 358.

Context: Close at hand is a bridge over the River Thames, an admirable vantage ground for us to make a survey. The river flows beneath; barges pass, laden with timber, bursting with corn; there on one side are the domes and spires of the city; on the other, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament. It is a place to stand on by the hour, dreaming. But not now. Now we are pressed for time. Now we are here to consider facts; now we must fix our eyes upon the procession-the procession of the sons of educated men.There they go, our brothers who have been educated at public schools and universities, mounting those steps, passing in and out of those doors, ascending those pulpits, preaching, teaching, administering justice, practising medicine, transacting business, making money. It is a solemn sight always - a procession, like a caravanserai crossing a desert. ... But now, for the past twenty years or so, it is no longer a sight merely, a photograph, or fresco scrawled upon the walls of time, at which we can look with merely an esthetic appreciation. For there, trapesing along at the tail end of the procession, we go ourselves. And that makes a difference. We who have looked so long at the pageant in books, or from a curtained window watched educated men leaving the house at about nine-thirty to go to an office, returning to the house at about six-thirty from an office, need look passively no longer. We too can leave the house, can mount those steps, pass in and out of those doors, ... make money, administer justice. ... We who now agitate these humble pens may in another century or two speak from a pulpit. Nobody will dare contradict us then; we shall be the mouthpieces of the divine spirit-a solemn thought, is it not? Who can say whether, as time goes on, we may not dress in military uniform, with gold lace on our breasts, swords at our sides, and something like the old family coal-scuttle on our heads, save that that venerable object was never decorated with plumes of white horsehair. You laugh-indeed the shadow of the private house still makes those dresses look a little queer. We have worn private clothes so long. ... But we have not come here to laugh, or to talk of fashions-men's and women's. We are here, on the bridge, to ask ourselves certain questions. And they are very important questions; and we have very little time in which to answer them. The questions that we have to ask and to answer about that procession during this moment of transition are so important that they may well change the lives of all men and women for ever. For we have to ask ourselves, here and now, do we wish to join that procession, or don't we? On what terms shall we join that procession? Above all, where is it leading us, the procession of educated men? The moment is short; it may last five years; ten years, or perhaps only a matter of a few months longer. ... But, you will object, you have no time to think; you have your battles to fight, your rent to pay, your bazaars to organize. That excuse shall not serve you, Madam. As you know from your own experience, and there are facts that prove it, the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking from hand to mouth; not under green lamps at study tables in the cloisters of secluded colleges. They have thought while they stirred the pot, while they rocked the cradle. It was thus that they won us the right to our brand-new sixpence. It falls to us now to go on thinking; how are we to spend that sixpence? Think we must. Let us think in offices; in omnibuses; while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and Lord Mayor's Shows; let us think ... in the gallery of the House of Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages and funerals. Let us never cease from thinking-what is this ""civilization"" in which we find ourselves? What are these ceremonies and why should we take part in them? What are these professions and why should we make money out of them? Where in short is it leading us, the procession of the sons of educated men?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and then reflected on my mistake and how I could improve my answer. Here is my reflection:

At first, I misunderstood the central claim of the passage and answered incorrectly. Upon reflection, I realized that the central claim of the passage is that educated women face a decision about how to engage with existing institutions. The passage argues that women have traditionally been excluded from positions of power in English society, but that they now have the opportunity to join the procession of educated men and shape the direction of these institutions. The passage emphasizes the importance of women's participation in these institutions and the need for them to make informed decisions about how to engage with them.

I apologize for any confusion this may have caused and will strive to be more careful in my future answers.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer.

After re-reading the passage, I realized that the main purpose of the author is to question the feasibility of the procession of the sons of educated men. The author raises important questions about the direction of this procession and the impact it will have on society. The author emphasizes the urgency of these questions and the need for immediate answers. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) question the feasibility of an undertaking.

Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:

Problem: The passage presents a critical view of the procession of the sons of educated men, raising questions about its purpose and impact on society.

Solution: I initially thought the main purpose of the passage was to emphasize the value of a tradition, but upon further reflection, I realized that the author's main purpose is to question the feasibility of the procession.

Correct answer: (D) question the feasibility of an undertaking.

In conclusion, my self-reflection helped me to accurately identify the main purpose of the passage, which is to question the feasibility of the procession of the sons of educated men.","Choice B is the best answer.

I previously answered choice C, ""She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition,"" as the reaction Akira most fears from Chie. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

From the passage, it is clear that Akira is eager to make a good impression on Chie and secure her approval for his proposal. He has come directly to the Fuji household, breaking a tradition, and has delivered his message with sincerity and formality. He has also shown respect for Chie's position by asking for her hand directly and offering to become Naomi's yoshi (a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name).

Therefore, the reaction that Akira most fears from Chie is choice B, ""She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity."" Akira is concerned that Chie may view him as overly eager or immature for proposing to Naomi without proper introduction or approval from her parents. This fear is evident in his nervousness and eagerness to make a good impression on Chie.

[REDACTED]","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general. This can be seen in the first paragraph of Passage 1, where Tocqueville explains that raising woman to be ""more and more the equal of man"" is part of the overall ""social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant,"" and in the first paragraph of Passage 2, where Mill writes that ""mankind have outgrown"" the state of inequality and ""now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality,"" with gender roles being the last of these relations to undergo such a shift.Choice B is incorrect because although in Passage 1 Tocqueville argues that there are costs to treating men and women the same, in Passage 2 Mill characterizes gender equality as a source of benefits only. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither author considers changing gender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead on questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people's potential.

Reflection:
I previously answered choice (A) The corrupting influence of a materialistic society as the best description of a major theme in the passage. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not accurate. The passage does not suggest that Eppie's materialism is a major theme. Instead, the passage highlights the contrast between Eppie's energetic and curious nature and Silas's enfeebled spirit. Eppie's influence on Silas is a major theme in the passage, as she brings new life and joy to his existence.

Therefore, the best description of a major theme in the passage is choice (C) The bittersweet brevity of childhood naïveté. The passage shows how Eppie's innocence and curiosity bring new life to Silas's spirit, but also how she will eventually grow up and lose her innocence. This theme is evident in the passage's description of Eppie's mischievous behavior and Silas's struggle to balance his love for her with his need to teach her about the world.

A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

Initial Answer: I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the percentage of surface covered with weeds would be higher than Hartmann's original prediction. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the information provided in the passage. The passage states that the field plowed at night had a much lower percentage of surface covered with weeds compared to the field plowed during the day. This suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in a lower percentage of surface covered with weeds, which is option A.

[REDACTED]

In conclusion, my initial answer was incorrect, and I have revised my answer to option B, which is the correct answer based on the information provided in the passage.","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",B,A,0,1661,180,1841,

Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals. She argues that rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, and that the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman. Grimké asserts that when human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. Therefore, her central claim is that moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals, and that men and women have equal moral rights.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66).

I previously answered choice (D) naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Passage 2 suggests that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance for being impractical, rather than naive.

The passage states that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans living in the present to resist foreign domination. This implies that the Filipinos are capable of organizing themselves and defending their rights, rather than being passive recipients of American governance. Additionally, the passage notes that the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources, which suggests that they are not willing to accept a subordinate role in the eyes of the American government.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (C) impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.

Answer: (C) Impractical.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines.

The correct answer is (C) The narrator hints at Silas's former antisocial attitude by contrasting his present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them.

Reflection:

In the passage, the narrator describes Silas's former obsession with his gold, which required him to sit weaving for long hours, deafened and blinded to everything else. This suggests that Silas was antisocial and isolated, preferring to spend his time alone with his gold rather than interacting with his neighbors. The narrator also contrasts Silas's behavior toward his neighbors before and after he adopted Eppie, indicating that he has become more social and caring since adopting the child. This contrast suggests that Silas's character has changed, and the narrator uses this contrast to hint at his former antisocial attitude.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator describes Silas as having been so obsessed as to have felt required to worship the gold ""in close-locked solitude,"" with ""his thoughts in an ever-repeated circle"" centered on his hoard. Moreover, this obsession compelled him to ""sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.” These lines convey the extent to which Silas's behaviors were determined by his obsession.Choice B is incorrect because the narrator does not make it seem as if Silas's gold could reproduce on its own, with the first paragraph suggesting that his hoard was a consequence of hard work, his being ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.""

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The narrator indicates that Sempere does not take his money for the books he buys. Sempere lets the narrator read the books for free, and the narrator only pays for the books when he can. This is evident in the passage when the narrator says, ""He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left."" This suggests that the narrator pays Sempere nothing or very little for the books he buys. Therefore, the best answer is (B) Nothing, because Sempere won't take his money.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator explains that although Sempere normally didn't charge him for books, he still left Sempere a few coins as payment: ""It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers."" These lines signal the narrator's awareness that he was paying less for the books than they were worth.Choice A is incorrect because the passage states that Sempere didn't expect or want the narrator to pay: ""He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books."" Choice B is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that even if Sempere didn't want the narrator's money, the narrator would still ""leave the coins I'd managed to collect."" Choice C is incorrect because the third paragraph states that the money with which the narrator paid Sempere was originally given to the narrator by his father.",B,D,0,1274,237,1511,

Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that the acquisition of flight in young birds can provide insights into the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. He observed that young birds in the wild prefer to rest on elevated perches, such as ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches, where they are safe from predators. However, in his controlled research setting, he found that young birds were using their legs to climb up hay bales instead of flying up to perches. This observation led him to conclude that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, which is the central assumption of his research.

The mention of the diamond ring on his fourth finger and the American Legion button on his lapel also suggest that Mr. Peters is conscious of symbols of wealth and power, but his preoccupation with these symbols is not the main idea of the paragraph.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is choice C: the gift meant that Sempere held him in high regard.

The passage highlights the narrator's admiration for Sempere and the significance of the gift he gave him. Sempere's gesture of giving the narrator a rare and valuable book, especially one written by a friend of his, shows that he holds the narrator in high regard. This is evident in the narrator's response to the gift, where he expresses his desire to learn from Mr. Dickens and become a writer himself.

The passage highlights the development of their relationship, including Mr. Peters' recognition of the young man's influence on him and the diamond ring on the young man's finger. This shift in focus is evident in the passage as the author describes the interactions between the different characters in the restaurant, including Lymie reading a book, the arrival of a coat that Lymie recognizes as his father's, and the exchange between Mr. Peters and the young man. The passage emphasizes the personal connections and relationships that emerge in the restaurant, rather than Lymie's inner thoughts or observations of the physical setting.","Choice D is the best answer.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option C: divine gift to the American people. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually supports option B: replication of conditions in Europe.

In Passage 1, Beveridge argues that the United States has the resources and immensity to feed and clothe the world, and that its coastlines enclose half the countries of Europe. He also states that the United States is set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe. These statements suggest that the United States is destined to replicate the conditions found in Europe, with its own imperial expansion and global influence.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

In the passage, both authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society as being determined by their abilities and capacities, rather than by their sex or any other inherent characteristic. Tocqueville argues that each individual should have the largest and highest sphere of activity possible, based on their unique talents and faculties, and that society should be organized in such a way as to allow for the free exercise of these abilities. Mill takes a similar view, stating that each individual should have the freedom to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents, without being hindered by societal expectations or limitations based on their sex or any other factor.

In contrast, choice (A) suggests that Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by their sex, while choice (B) suggests that Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by their economic class. Neither of these options is supported by the passage, which emphasizes the importance of individual ability and capacity in determining an individual's proper position in society.

Similarly, choice (D) suggests that Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. However, the passage does not support this interpretation, as it emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and autonomy in determining an individual's proper position in society.

In conclusion, the best answer is choice (C), as it most accurately reflects the ways in which the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",C,A,0,1527,370,1897,

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually chooses the setting of the bridge because it is symbolic of the legacy of past and present sons of educated men.

The passage describes the bridge as a ""caravanserai crossing a desert,"" which suggests a sense of passage and transition. The author suggests that the procession of the sons of educated men is a long-standing tradition that has been occurring for centuries, and that they are now at a crossroads, deciding whether to join this procession or not. The bridge serves as a symbol of this legacy, representing the passage of time and the accumulation of knowledge and experience.

Furthermore, the author notes that the daughters of educated men have always done their thinking ""from hand to mouth,"" suggesting that they have been actively engaged in shaping their own destinies. The bridge serves as a symbol of this active engagement, representing the idea that the procession of the sons of educated men is not a fixed or predetermined path, but rather a choice that requires active participation and engagement.

Initial answer: I chose answer (A) because I thought that exposure to light allowed seeds to begin to develop. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage actually states that exposure to light allows seeds to germinate. The passage explains that when farmers plow their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight, which stimulates their germination.

[REDACTED]","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The passage summarizes research on the relationship between plowing and weed growth. According to the fourth paragraph, the research of Karl Hartmann suggests that plowing fields during the day leads to weed growth because exposure to even small amounts of light can ""induce seed germination,"" or cause seeds to sprout. Thus, according to the passage, exposure to light allows seeds to begin to develop.Choices $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the passage indicates that small amounts of light cause seeds to sprout, but it doesn't explicitly assert that light exposure allows seeds to absorb necessary nutrients (choice (B)and doesn't discuss whether light exposure helps seeds achieve maximum growth (choice D).

","  Topic: English

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window. ""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Question: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a

Answer: B: depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted.

Explanation: The passage initially focuses on the narrator's father and his dislike of books, but gradually shifts to the narrator's fascination with the author Charles Dickens and his desire to emulate him. The passage describes the narrator's secret reading habits, his favorite bookshop, and his newfound love for Great Expectations, indicating a growing obsession with the author and his works.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",,A,0,1317,959,2276,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B: They will be valuable only if they can be harvested cheaply. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.

The passage in Passage 1 highlights the potential value of resources such as water, iron, silicon, and aluminum, which are abundant in the moon's poles and asteroids. These resources are likely to be highly valued in space due to their scarcity and versatility. The passage also mentions the potential for water to be used as a radiation shield or for drinking, which further supports the idea that water will be a valuable resource in space.

In contrast, Passage 2 focuses on the economic motivations for deep-space travel and the potential consequences of space mining. The passage notes that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different from those on Earth, and that their stewardship has barely been broached. This suggests that the resources that will be highly valued in space are likely to be different from those on Earth, which supports option C.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet. Passage 2 says this explicitly in lines 74-76: ""The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth.""

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the data provided in the table do not necessarily support this claim. While it is true that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, this does not necessarily mean that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

The table only provides information on the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen, and does not provide information on the severity of the infection or the timing of the infection. It is possible that the colonies with colony collapse disorder were already weakened by other factors, such as nutritional deficiencies or pesticide exposure, which made them more susceptible to infection with varroa mites.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder."" This answer choice acknowledges that the data provided in the table do support the authors' claim, but also recognizes that other factors may be at play in the colonies with colony collapse disorder.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer.

Initial Answer: B

After reflecting on my initial answer, I realized that the information provided in the passage does not support the claim that the authors are presenting an alternate hypothesis about the composition of a nucleotide. The passage is focused on providing evidence for the structure of DNA, including the number of chains in a molecule of DNA and the base composition of DNA from various organisms. The authors are using the X-ray evidence and density to support their claims about the structure of DNA, not to present an alternate hypothesis.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) confirm the relationship between the density of DNA and the known chemical formula of DNA. The authors are using the X-ray evidence to confirm the expected density of DNA based on its chemical formula, which supports their conclusion about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov's experiment demonstrated that it is indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to close, which supports Hodick and Sievers's model. However, the passage also states that if it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open, which contradicts a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

He uses phrases such as ""the noble land that God has given us"" and ""the propagandists and not the misers of liberty"" to convey a sense of moral obligation and purpose.

Similarly, Bryan highlights the contradictions of American imperialism, arguing that the United States cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle at home. He emphasizes the importance of democracy and the love of liberty that is inherent in all human beings.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: idealism that permeates many aspects of American society. Both Beveridge and Bryan's arguments are rooted in a belief in the moral and ideological principles that underpin American society, rather than its historical foundations.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government.""

I previously answered this question as Choice A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that the Venus flytrap is able to identify the species of its prey based on the number of triggers it receives. Instead, the passage highlights the importance of the multiple triggers in ensuring that the plant does not waste its energy on small prey. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",D,C,0,1382,131,1513,

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""describe a culture."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as stated in option C. The speaker is expressing surprise and amusement at the young man's bold move and is curious about the young man's intentions. The use of phrases such as ""I think you should go,"" ""How am I involved?"", and ""Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?"" indicate that the speaker is skeptical and curious about the situation. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, ""question a suggestion.""","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1560,150,1710,
