","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves making a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, and then analyzing the results. If the results do not match the hypothesis, the experiment should be repeated to ensure that the results were not due to experimental error. If the results consistently do not match the hypothesis, then the hypothesis may need to be revised.
