We need to maximize the use of single letters before moving to pairs. 
With 26 letters in the alphabet, we can assign single letters to 26 types of books. Since we only have 10 types, we only need single letters.
Action: Answer(""A"") 
","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

Solving for x, we get x ≈ 16. 
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

","Thought:
Let the speed of the car be v and the height of the tower be h. 
Let the car be at points A and B when the angles of elevation are 45° and 60° respectively. Let the base of the tower be C.
From the given information, we have:
* Angle ACB = 60°
* Angle AC[REDACTED] = 45°
* Time taken to travel from [REDACTED] to B = 10 minutes
We can use trigonometry to relate the distances and angles:
* In triangle ABC: tan(60°) = h/BC, so BC = h/√3
* In triangle A[REDACTED]C: tan(45°) = h/A[REDACTED]C, so A[REDACTED]C = h
The distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes is A[REDACTED]B = A[REDACTED]C - BC = h - h/√3 = h(√3 - 1)/√3
Since the speed is uniform, we can use the formula: time = distance/speed
Time taken to reach the base (C) from B = BC/v = (h/√3) / v = h / (v√3)
To find the time in terms of the given 10 minutes, we can divide the time to reach C from B by the time to travel from [REDACTED] to B:
(h / (v√3)) / (h(√3 - 1)/(v√3)) = 1 / (√3 - 1)
To rationalize the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√3 + 1):
1 / (√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1) / (√3 + 1) = (√3 + 1) / 2
Therefore, the additional time needed is (√3 + 1)/2 times the 10 minutes:
Time = 10 * (√3 + 1)/2 = 5(√3 + 1) minutes 
Action: Answer(""A"") 
","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

In 40g of alloy X, zinc = (6/15)*40 = 16g and copper = (9/15)*40 = 24g.
In 60g of alloy Y, zinc = (7/18)*60 = 70/3 g and copper = (11/18)*60 = 110/3 g.
In alloy Z, zinc = 16 + 70/3 = 118/3 g and copper = 24 + 110/3 = 182/3 g.
Ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z = (118/3) / (182/3) = 59:91.

Let's denote the initial amounts of money as A for Arjun and S for Sajal. We can set up two equations based on the given information:
* **Scenario 1:** If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. This translates to:  S + 30 = 2(A - 30)
* **Scenario 2:** If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This translates to:  A + 10 = 3(S - 10)
Solving this system of equations will give us the values for A and S.

","Suppose Arun has $X and Sajal has $Y. then,
2(x-30)= y+30 => 2x-y =90 …(i)

Since B bisects minor arc AC, which is 160°, then arcs AB and BC are each 80°. 
Therefore, arc AD is the sum of arcs AB and BD, which is 80° + 150° = 230°. 
However, this is a major arc. To find the minor arc AD, we subtract this value from 360°: 360° - 230° = 130°.

","B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees. Now , we have arc BD = 150, therefore CD = 70.

The profit sharing ratio is based on the product of investment and time.
So, the ratio for A:B:C is (40000*12):(60000*10):(120000*x)
C's share is 150,000 out of 375,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: (120000*x) / (480000 + 600000 + 120000x) = 2/5
