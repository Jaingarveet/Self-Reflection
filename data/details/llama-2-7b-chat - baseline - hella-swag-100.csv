[header] How to break a trauma bond
[title] Write a story about the relationship.
[step] Gaining some perspective on an abusive or dysfunctional relationship can be helpful when you are trying to break a trauma bond. One way that you can do this is by writing a story about your relationship.

Choices:

A: In your story, try to frame your relationship in a way that sets you apart from others. [substeps] Make a list of key events in your relationship.

Explanation: This option is likely because the text suggests that gaining perspective on the relationship can be helpful in breaking a trauma bond. Writing a story about the relationship can provide a way to process and understand the dynamics of the relationship, which can be an important step in breaking free from a trauma bond. By framing the relationship in a way that sets you apart from others, you can gain a more objective perspective on the relationship and identify patterns and behaviors that may be contributing to the trauma bond.

B: Write the story in the third person, such as by calling yourself by your proper name. For example, if your name is Janet, then refer to yourself as Janet in the story.

Explanation: This option is also likely because writing a story in the third person can provide a sense of distance and objectivity, which can be helpful in gaining perspective on the relationship. By referring to yourself by your proper name, you can create a sense of separation between yourself and the events of the story, which can make it easier to analyze and understand the relationship.

C: Write about a person and your relationship with them. Show the characters what the relationship was like the first time you saw them.

Explanation: This option is less likely because it does not directly address the prompt of writing a story about the relationship. While writing about a person and your relationship with them can be a therapeutic way to process emotions and gain perspective, it does not specifically address the task of breaking a trauma bond.

D: Draw pictures and detailed descriptions and write down facts about the relationship that support your story. [substeps] Alternatively, you may find that your partner is using abusive language to justify his or her abuse and you try writing a story about the abuse.

Explanation: This option is also less likely because it does not directly address the prompt of writing a story about the relationship. While drawing pictures and writing down facts about the relationship can be a way to process and understand the dynamics of the relationship, it does not specifically address the task of breaking a trauma bond.
