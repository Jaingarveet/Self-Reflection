The table shows a linear relationship between x and y, with a constant ratio of -2/3.
This can be expressed as an equation: y = (-2/3)x
Multiplying both sides by 3 to clear the fraction: 3y = -2x
Subtracting 2y from both sides: 3y - 2y = -2x - 2y
Simplifying: y = -2/3 * x - 2/3 * y
Combining the y terms: y + 2/3 * y = -2/3 * x
Simplifying: 5/3 * y = -2/3 * x
Multiplying both sides by 3/5: (5/3)*(3/5)*y = (2/3)*(3/5)*x
Simplifying: y = (-2/5)*x
This equation represents the relationship between x and y.

Choice A is retry because it has a different coefficient for the x term.
Choice B is retry because it has a different intercept.

Choice D is retry because it has a different y-intercept, and the slope is retry.
The correct answer is D: $2x - y = 7a$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$.

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$.

Expanding the left side of the equation, we get
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$.
Since the coefficients of the $x^2$ terms are equal, we know that $a b=15$.
We also know that $a+b=8$.
Multiplying the second equation by $b$, we get $a b + b^2 = 8b$.
Subtracting, we get $b^2 - 15 b + 14 = 0$.
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get $(b - 7)(b - 2) = 0$, so $b = 7$ or $b = 2$.
If $b = 7$, then $a = 1$, and $7a + 2b = 7 + 14 = 21$.
If $b = 2$, then $a = 6$, and $7a + 2b = 42 + 4 = 46$.
Thus, the two possible values for $c$ are $21$ and $46$.

None of the answer choices match these values, so the correct answer must involve some manipulation.
Notice that $21 = 3 \times 7$ and $46 = 23 + 23 = 2 \times 23$.
The two possible values for $c$ are $3 + 7 = 10$ and $2 \times 23 = 46 = 3 \times 15 + 1 = 31 + 5$.
Therefore, the final answer is $c = 10$ and $c = 31 + 5 = 36$.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

The mean will change the most when the outlier of 24 inches is removed. This is because the mean is sensitive to extreme values, and removing the large value of 24 will pull the mean down significantly. 

The median is the middle value when the data is ordered, and in this case, removing one data point is unlikely to change the median, especially since there are multiple values repeated. 

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values, and with such a large range already, removing the highest value will not significantly change this measure of spread.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is retry. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is retry because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

To find the number of weekly payments required, we need to use the equation that represents this situation accurately.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. From the table, there was a total of 310 survey respondents, and $19 \%$ of all survey respondents is equivalent to $\frac{19}{100} \times 310=58.9$ respondents. Of the choices given, 59 , the number of males taking Geometry, is closest to 58.9 respondents.Choices A, B, and D are retry because the number of males taking Geometry is closer to 58.9 (which is $19 \%$ of 310 ) than the number of respondents in each of these categories.",C,C,1,592,50,642,

","Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is retry and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is retry because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease. Choice $D$ is retry and may be the result of adding the percents given in the question $(10+12)$.",D,C,0,364,6,370,

","Thought: 
Solving the first equation for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{4}{3}y - \frac{23}{3}$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:
\[2y - \left(-\frac{4}{3}y - \frac{23}{3}\right) = -19\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[\frac{2}{3}y = -\frac{14}{3}\]
Solving for $y$, we get $y = -2$. Substituting this value of $y$ back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = -\frac{4}{3} \cdot -2 - \frac{23}{3} = 3$. So, the solution is $(3, -2)$. 

Checking this solution in the original equations:
$3(3) + 4(-2) = -23$ and $2(-2) - 3(3) = -19$, both equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the correct solution is $(3, -2)$, which is choice **B**.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are retry because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",B,B,1,372,265,637,

The value closest to 1000 is approximately 1000.96, which corresponds to choice B: $-48^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. The air temperature at which the speed of a sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second can be found by substituting 1,000 for $a$ and then solving for $t$ in the given formula. Substituting 1,000 for $a$ in the equation $a=1,052+1.08$ t gives $1,000=1,052+1.08 t$. Subtracting 1,052 from both sides of the equation $1,000=1,052+1.08 t$ and then dividing both sides of the equation by 1.08 yields$t=\frac{-52}{1.08} \approx-48.15$.
