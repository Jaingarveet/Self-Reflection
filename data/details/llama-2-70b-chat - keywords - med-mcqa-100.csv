Necrosis is a form of cell death that occurs due to injury, infection, or other types of cellular stress. It is a type of accidental cell death, as opposed to apoptosis, which is a programmed form of cell death.

Choice A, Ca+2 efflux in cell, is incorrect. Although calcium ions (Ca2+) play a role in many cellular processes, including cell signaling and muscle contraction, they are not directly involved in necrosis.

Choice B, Fat deposition in cells, is also incorrect. Fat deposition, or lipidosis, is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in cells. This can occur due to various factors, such as genetic disorders or exposure to certain chemicals, but it is not directly related to necrosis.

Choice C, Water imbibition in cells, is incorrect. Water imbibition refers to the uptake of water by cells, which can cause them to swell. While this can be a problem in certain contexts, such as in plants exposed to excessive water, it is not a primary mechanism of necrosis.

Choice D, Enzymatic digestion, is the correct answer. Necrosis can occur due to enzymatic digestion, which is the breakdown of cells by enzymes. This can happen when cells are exposed to certain toxins or when there is an imbalance in the cellular environment.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Enzymatic digestion.

Topic: Medicine

Question: Investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis-
Choices:
  A: USG
  B: UGI series
  C: CT
  D: MRI

Pyloric stenosis is a condition that affects the pylorus, the region between the stomach and the small intestine. The investigation of choice would depend on the symptoms and clinical findings.

I previously selected option A, USG (Ultrasonography), as my answer. However, USG is not the best choice for evaluating pyloric stenosis. USG is primarily used for obstetrics and gynecology, and it may not provide adequate information about the pylorus or any potential stenosis.

The correct answer is option C, CT (Computed Tomography). CT scans are excellent for evaluating the abdominal contents, including the pylorus. It can help diagnose pyloric stenosis by visualizing the narrowing or obstruction of the pylorus and any associated findings such as thickening or inflammation of the muscularis externa.

Option B, UGI series (Upper Gastrointestinal Series), is not the best choice for evaluating pyloric stenosis. UGI series is a radiological examination that uses barium to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract. While it may show abnormalities in the pylorus, it is not as sensitive or specific as CT scans for diagnosing pyloric stenosis.

Option D, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), is also not the best choice for evaluating pyloric stenosis. MRI is excellent for evaluating soft tissues, but it may not provide adequate information about the pylorus or any potential stenosis.

In summary, the investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis is a CT scan. I apologize for my previous mistake and hope this answer better reflects my understanding of the topic.

Which antithyroid drug can be safely used in pregnancy?
The key here is to identify the antithyroid drug with the best safety profile during pregnancy, particularly regarding congenital malformations.
A: Propylthiouracil has been associated with congenital malformations, including aplastic anemia and choanal atresia. Therefore, it is not the best option for pregnant women.
B: I121 is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety profile during pregnancy is not well established. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.
C: Methimazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, with a low risk of congenital malformations. However, it can cause neonatal thyroid suppression and transient hypothyroidism in the newborn.
D: Carbimazole is the preferred antithyroid drug during pregnancy, as it has a better safety profile than other options. Although it can also cause neonatal thyroid suppression, the risk is lower compared to methimazole.
Reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I overlooked the importance of the safety profile during pregnancy. Now, I have reevaluated the options, and my answer is:

The correct diagnosis for the 60-year-old male with right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, sometimes blood-tinged, based on the biopsy finding, is Rhinoscleroma.

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is caused by the bacteria Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the nasal tissue. The symptoms of Rhinoscleroma include nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and epistaxis (nosebleeds). The biopsy finding in this case, which shows the presence of granulomas, supports the diagnosis of Rhinoscleroma.

Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis that affects the respiratory, renal, and nervous systems. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas in the affected organs. While Wegener's granulomatosis can affect the nasal passages and sinuses, it is not typically associated with nasal obstruction and nasal discharge.

Stewa's granuloma is a rare condition that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the nasal tissue and can cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction and epistaxis. However, Stewa's granuloma is not typically associated with nasal discharge.

Rhinosporidiosis is a rare fungal infection that affects the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses. It is caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi and is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the nasal tissue. While Rhinosporidiosis can cause nasal obstruction and epistaxis, it is not typically associated with nasal discharge.

In conclusion, based on the symptoms and biopsy finding, the diagnosis for the 60-year-old male is Rhinoscleroma.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4.

Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question and choices again.
The question asks why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.

A: Pka is equal to Ph:
The pKa of a buffer determines the pH range it can effectively buffer. A buffer with a pKa close to the physiological pH (7.4) would be more effective. However, bicarbonate's pKa (6.1) is not equal to the physiological pH, so this choice is incorrect.

B: High concentration:
Bicarbonate is present in blood at a relatively high concentration (24 mmol/L). A high concentration of a buffer can help maintain the desired pH range. However, this is not the primary reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.

C: Weak acid and weak base combination:
Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is a weak base, and carbonic acid (H2CO3) is a weak acid. Their combination forms a buffer system that helps maintain blood pH. This is the correct reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.

D: Easy to measure:
While it is important to measure pH and buffer levels in blood, this is not the primary reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal.

Reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the question and chose an incorrect answer. The correct answer is C: Weak acid and weak base combination.

Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

B. Placenta previa: This is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It can cause bleeding during pregnancy and delivery, but it doesn't typically cause an unstable lie.

C. Pelvic tumor: This is a rare condition that can cause an unstable lie, but it's not a common cause.

D. Uterine anomalies: This is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. Uterine anomalies can cause the fetus to shift and change position, leading to an unstable lie.
