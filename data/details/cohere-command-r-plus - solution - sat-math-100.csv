$\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{4}{3}$

Multiply both sides by $\frac{5}{3}$ to solve for $w$:

","Thought: 
The equation should represent the relationship between $x$ and $y$.
Given that the table shows a linear relationship with a negative slope, the equation should be of the form $y = mx, where m is the negative ratio of the change in 'y' to the change in 'x'. 

From the table, as $x$ increases by $3a, y$ decreases by $a$. So, the slope $m = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-1}{3}$. 

Substituting this value of $m$ into the equation $y = mx$, we get $y = \left(\frac{-1}{3}\right)x$. 

To make $x$ the subject, we can rearrange to get $2x - 3y = 0$. 

This equation represents the relationship where the y-intercept is $0$, and the slope is $-\frac{1}{3}$, which is consistent with the table. 

Therefore, the correct answer is $x + 2y = a$, as it simplifies to $2x - 3y = 0$ when simplified.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

Given equations:
$$\begin{aligned} y &= x^2 \\ 2y + 6 &= 2(x + 3) \end{aligned}$$

Solving for $x$ and $y$:
Step 1: The first equation gives $y = x^2$.

Step 2: Substituting $y$ into the second equation yields $2(x^2) + 6 = 2x + 6$.

Step 3: Simplifying and rearranging gives $x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0$.

Step 4: Applying the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-8)}}{2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{36}}{2} = 1 \pm 3\sqrt{5}$$

For $x > 0$, take the positive value:
$$x = 1 + 3\sqrt{5}$$

Step 5: Substituting $x$ into $y = x^2$:
$$y = (1 + 3\sqrt{5})^2 = (1 + 3\sqrt{5}) \cdot (1 + 3\sqrt{5}) = 10 + 6\sqrt{5}$$

$$x y = (1 + 3\sqrt{5})(10 + 6\sqrt{5}) = 10 + 30\sqrt{5} + 30\sqrt{5} + 90 = 40 + 60\sqrt{5}$$

$$x y = 40 + 60 \cdot \sqrt{5} = 40 + 12 \cdot 5 \cdot \sqrt{5} = 12(5 + \sqrt{5}) = 12 \cdot 5 \cdot (1 + \sqrt{5}) = 60(1 + \sqrt{5})$$

","Thought: 
To find the weight of an object on a different planet, we can use the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight, $m$ is the mass, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on that planet. In this case, we know that the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons, and we want to find the planet where this same object would weigh approximately 170 newtons.

Let's calculate the mass of the object using Earth's gravity:
\[m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{150 \text{ N}}{9.8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2}} \approx 15.30 \text{ kg}\]

Now that we have the mass, we can find the planet where this mass would result in a weight of approximately 170 newtons:
- For Venus: $W = mg = 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 8.9 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 136.20 \text{ N}$
- For Saturn: $W = mg = 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 11.1 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 169.83 \text{ N}$
- For Uranus: $W = mg = 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 10.7 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 163.71 \text{ N}$
- For Neptune: $W = mg = 15.30 \text{ kg} \times 14.1 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{sec}^2} \approx 215.73 \text{ N}$

From the calculations, we can see that Saturn is the planet where the object's weight would be closest to 170 newtons.

Substituting this mass into the formula $W=m g$ and now using the weight of 170 newtons gives $170=15.3 g$, which shows that the second planet's acceleration due to gravity is about $11.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$.

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

We can simplify the equation as follows:

C: $f(1) = 3(1)-5 = -2$
D: $f(4) = 4(1)-6 = -2$

Only choice B satisfies the equation, so the correct answer is B: $f(n) = 2n - 4$.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line that passes through each of the points given in the table. From the table, one can see that an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$; for example, $f 2)-f(1)=1-(-2)=3$. Therefore, the graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line with slope 3. Only choice $\mathrm{C}$ is a line with slope 3. The $y$-intercept of the line is the value of $f(0)$. Since an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$, it follows that $f 1)-f(0)=3$. Since $f(1)=-2$, it follows that $f(0)=f(1)-3=-5$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the graph of $f(n)$ is -5 , and the equation in slope-intercept form that defined $f$ is $f(n)=3 n-5$.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each equation has the incorrect slope of the line (the $y$-intercept in each equation is also incorrect).",B,C,0,437,173,610,

","Thought: 
Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the original rectangle. 
The original area of the rectangle is $LW$. 

After altering the rectangle, the new length is $110\% \times L = 1.1L$, and the new width is $W\% \times W = (1 - \frac{p}{100})W$. 

The new area of the rectangle, $A'$, is given by:
$$A' = LW \times \left( \frac{1.1}{100} \right) \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right)$$

We know that this alteration results in a $12\%$ decrease in the area, so:
$$A' = LW \times 0.88$$

Setting the equations equal to each other and simplifying:
$$LW \times \left( \frac{1.1}{100} \right) \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right) = LW \times 0.88$$
$$1.1 \times \left( 1 - \frac{p}{100} \right) = 0.88$$
$$1.1 - 1.1p/100 = 0.88$$
$$1.1 - 0.88 = 1.1p/100$$
$$0.22 = 1.1p/100$$
$$0.22 \times 100 = 1.1p$$
$$22 = 1.1p$$
$$p = \frac{22}{1.1}$$
$$p \approx \boxed{20}$$
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is incorrect because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease.

","Thought: 
First, we solve for $x$ in the second equation to get $x = 2y - 19$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:
$3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$, which simplifies to $6y - 57 = -23$, and then $6y = 34$, so $y = \frac{17}{3}$. Substituting $y$ back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = 2(\frac{17}{3}) - 19 = -5$. Thus, the solution is $(x, y) = (-5, \frac{17}{3})$, which is not among the choices.

Reflection:
My previous solution was incorrect because I made a mistake in solving for one of the variables. I correctly solved for $y$ but made a calculation error when substituting back to find $x$. I should have found $x = -5$, but instead, I incorrectly calculated it as $3$. This led me to choose the wrong answer. To avoid such mistakes in the future, I need to be more careful with my calculations and double-check my substitutions.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$.

","Reflection: I made a calculation error when solving this question previously. To find the temperature at which the speed of sound is closest to 1000 ft/s, I should have substituted values into the equation and solved for $t$. Instead, I incorrectly treated the values as absolute values and chose the answer that seemed closest to the calculated value. For a more accurate solution, I should ensure that I follow the equation precisely and check my calculations carefully.

Thought: 
To find the air temperature that results in a sound wave speed closest to 1000 ft/s, we need to substitute the given values into the equation and solve for $t$. 

Given equation: $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$

We want to find $t$ when $a$ is closest to 1000.

$1000 = 1,052 + 1.08t$

To isolate $t$, subtract 1,052 from both sides:

$1000 - 1,052 = 1,052 + 1.08t - 1,052$

$-52 = 1.08t$

Now, divide by 1.08 to solve for $t$:

$t = \frac{-52}{1.08} \approx -48.15$

The temperature closest to $-48.15^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ is $-48^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. The air temperature at which the speed of a sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second can be found by substituting 1,000 for $a$ and then solving for $t$ in the given formula.

Subtracting 1,052 from both sides of the equation $1,000=1,052+1.08 t$ and then dividing both sides of the equation by 1.08 yields$t=\frac{-52}{1.08} \approx-48.15$.
