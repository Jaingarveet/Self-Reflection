Also, K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.

The constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that Jaramillo and Kayne are assigned to different countries. Therefore, if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne must be assigned to either Yemen or Zambia. If Jaramillo is assigned to Yemen or Zambia, Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela. This constraint can be restated as ""If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.""

Option A: The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday. But the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so this option is not possible.

","Thought:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
Option A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Option B violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Option C violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Option D satisfies all the given rules and is a valid assignment of parking spaces.

If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan's session cannot meet on Thursday afternoon (because Olivia's session would have to be on Thursday morning, which is not possible). Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead a morning session. Therefore, Nessa's session must meet on Friday afternoon. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, if Olivia's session meets on Thursday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday morning. If Olivia's session meets on Friday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
