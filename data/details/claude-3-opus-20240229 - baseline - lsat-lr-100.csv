1. The question states that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
2. Cacti grow well in dry (not humid) climates, while orange trees grow well in warm (not cold) climates.
3. So, for most parts of the country to be suitable for either cacti or orange trees, most parts must be either dry or warm (or both).
4. Now, let's look at each answer choice:
   A: If half the country is both humid and cold, it would be unsuitable for both cacti and orange trees. This contradicts the given information, so this could be false.
   B: If most of the country is hot, it would be suitable for orange trees. This is consistent with the given information, so this cannot be definitively false.
   C: If some parts are neither cold nor humid, they would be suitable for cacti. This is consistent with the given information, so this cannot be definitively false.
   D: The information states that in most parts of the country, it is easy to grow cacti or orange trees. So it must be possible to raise cacti in at least some parts of the country. Therefore, this statement is false.

B: We can't determine this. The information doesn't tell us about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.
C: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, which are all Canadian films, also won at international festivals, then some of the international prize-winners must have been Canadian films.

1. The discrepancy is that the number of recorded tornadoes has increased significantly since 1953, but meteorologists say the factors causing tornadoes haven't changed.
2. We need to find the answer choice that best explains this discrepancy.
3. Choice A suggests meteorologists didn't understand tornado factors well before 1953. This doesn't directly explain the increase in recorded tornadoes.
4. Choice B mentions tornado intensity, which is not directly relevant to the number of tornadoes recorded.
5. Choice C notes the number has only slightly increased recently. This doesn't address the overall increase since 1953.
6. Choice D is about property damage, not the number of tornadoes.
7. Choice E states that many more citizens are helping detect tornadoes now compared to 1953. This could explain why more tornadoes are being recorded, even if the actual number of tornadoes hasn't changed much. More people looking means more tornadoes spotted.

C: The difficulty of including fiber in diets is not relevant to the argument's reasoning about the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer rates.
D: The argument treats fiber as a single entity without considering potential differences between fiber in fruits/vegetables and cereals. This could be a flaw if the cancer-fighting properties differ significantly.

3. Let's look at each choice:
   A) This doesn't provide a direct link between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance. It's about bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics.
   
   B) This choice suggests that bacteria in sewage sludge without heavy metals are not resistant to heavy metals or antibiotics. This supports the idea that heavy metal exposure is linked to antibiotic resistance.
   
   C) This choice suggests the reverse causality - that antibiotic resistance contributes to heavy metal resistance. This doesn't strengthen the argument about heavy metals causing antibiotic resistance.
   
   D) The presence of antibiotics in the sludge could be an alternative explanation for the antibiotic resistance, weakening the heavy metal hypothesis.
   
   E) Bacteria outside of sewage sludge being resistant to both heavy metals and antibiotics doesn't provide evidence for the specific link in sewage sludge that the microbiologist is arguing for.

3. This reasoning doesn't rely on whether using others' property without permission is always theft (A), or on the permissibility of lying (B).
4. Mike's reasoning also doesn't depend on whether Tom was harmed by Mike's use of his computer (E).
5. Mike's argument is essentially: Tom did X to Mary, so it's okay for me to do X to Tom. This is a form of reciprocity or ""tit for tat"" reasoning.

","To determine which assumption enables the professor's conclusion, let's break down the argument:
Premise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.
Premise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.
Premise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.
Conclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
The correct assumption should bridge the gap between the premises and the conclusion, specifically addressing Checkers's motive.
Choice A is too broad, as it assumes any company refusing competitor coupons is solely motivated by hurting the competitor.
Choice B is the correct assumption. If a company wants to hurt a competitor by refusing their coupons, they will do so even when accepting them would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers. This directly supports the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive.
Choice C provides an example but doesn't necessarily apply to Checkers's specific situation and motive.
Choice D focuses on the effect of accepting coupons rather than the motive behind refusing them.
Choice E is irrelevant, as the premise states that accepting the coupons would have satisfied Checkers's potential customers.

","Let's analyze the argument step by step:
1. The argument states that vegetarians have two individually sufficient reasons for not eating meat:
   a. Health considerations
   b. Aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures
2. The argument then introduces a supposition: Eating meat is essential to good health for humans.
3. Given this supposition, the argument suggests that the aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures becomes a less clear reason to stop eating meat.
The supposition is not used to:
- Disprove the vegetarian position entirely (A)
- Show the independence of the two reasons (B)
- Disprove the health benefits of a vegetarian diet (C)
- Show there is no sufficient reason for not eating meat (E)
Instead, the supposition is used to weaken the claim that the consciousness of animals alone is a sufficient reason for not eating meat, given the hypothetical necessity of meat for good health.

2. He then argues that since Brooks is already unhappy, he might as well quit.
The flaw in this argument is that it fails to consider that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance. Being unhappy in a job is not necessarily the same level of unhappiness as being unemployed and unable to find work.
Morgenstern's argument assumes that the unhappiness Brooks currently feels is equivalent to the potential unhappiness of not finding another job after quitting. This oversimplifies the situation and does not account for the fact that the level and consequences of unhappiness can differ significantly between the two scenarios.

","To determine which reasoning is most similar, I'll analyze the structure of the original reasoning and compare it to each choice.
Original reasoning:
- Game show winners choose between two equally desirable prizes
- They choose either the more expensive one or the more familiar one
- Ed's prizes are equally desirable and unfamiliar
- Therefore, Ed will choose prize A because it's more expensive
Choice A:
- Writers receive either an advance or royalties
- Al-Sofi received an advance
- Therefore, al-Sofi did not receive royalties
This follows a similar either/or structure, but lacks the key factor of equal desirability leading to the second factor being the decider.
Choice B:
- Children choose either the Rocket or Mouse ride first
- Janine chose the Rocket first
- Therefore, Janine wasn't near the Mouse for the first half hour
This has the either/or structure but doesn't involve any factors influencing the choice between the two options.
Choice C:
- Asteroid orbits are only eccentric if affected by a planet's gravity 
- Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravity, X is not
- Therefore, Y's orbit is more eccentric than X's
This follows the structure of two factors, where the presence of one (planet's gravity) leads to the second (eccentricity). Most similar so far.
Choice D:
- Students must choose physics or art
- Miyoko wants neither
- Therefore, Miyoko probably won't enter the program
Doesn't match, as Miyoko's dislike of both options leads her to likely not choose either.
Choice E:
- Rabbits either double back or flee to cover to avoid predators
- This rabbit has no nearby cover to flee to
- Therefore, it will try to double back 
This closely matches the original reasoning - two options, equally motivated by predator avoidance, and the lack of one option (cover) means it will choose the other (doubling back).

1. The lawyer states that accessing computer files without authorization is justified only if:
   a) The computer is typically used in the operation of a business, AND 
   b) There are reasonable grounds to believe the computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner.
2. Looking at the choices:
A) Sunok had Rey's permission, but Rey was not the computer's owner. The computer was owned by the store owners. This does not meet the lawyer's criteria.
B) The investigators accessed the firm's computer files without permission, believing it contained evidence of fraud. Even though no evidence was found, their action was justified based on the lawyer's principles because it was a business computer and they had reasonable grounds.
C) The police officer accessed Natalie's business computer without permission, but found no usable evidence. According to the lawyer, the action was not justified because no usable evidence was found.
D) Customs officials examined files on a business computer confiscated from a suspected smuggler. This seems to meet the lawyer's criteria for justified access.
E) The police officer accessed an employee's personal files on a business computer without authorization. This does not meet the lawyer's criteria because the files were personal, not business-related.
Based on the lawyer's stated principles, choice B most strongly aligns. The investigators' action was justified even though no evidence was ultimately found, because they had reasonable grounds to believe the business computer contained usable evidence.

2. The defendant's excuse is that he was confused about whether national or local codes applied.
3. The judge says this excuse might be acceptable if the defendant was charged with noncompliance with local codes.

B. The relative strictness of local vs. national codes is not the issue here.
C. This is not necessarily true and is not the basis for the judge's reasoning.

","Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The current school calendar was designed to accommodate early 20th-century agricultural life, where children needed long breaks to help with the harvest.
2. Most citizens are no longer involved in agricultural life.
3. Therefore, changes can be made to the school calendar to serve children's interests, and long breaks should be removed.
The argument concludes that long breaks should be removed because they are no longer needed to accommodate agricultural life. However, for this conclusion to be valid, there must be an unstated assumption that a school calendar without long breaks would better serve children's interests.
Without this assumption, the argument would not make sense. Just because long breaks are no longer needed for agricultural reasons does not necessarily mean they should be removed. There could be other reasons to keep them.
Therefore, the argument depends on the assumption that a school calendar without long breaks would serve children's interests more than the current calendar with long breaks.

1. The argument concludes that Grey likely read Jordan's book because they used the same unusual metaphor, and Jordan's book was published first.
2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for why Grey used the same metaphor as Jordan, without having read her book.
3. Choice A states that a text published in 1860, before either Jordan's or Grey's book, contained the same unusual metaphor and was probably known to both authors. This provides an alternative source from which both authors could have independently gotten the metaphor, weakening the argument that Grey must have read Jordan's book.

3. The teacher then counters this criticism by stating that research shows adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those without such anxieties.
4. Therefore, the teacher concludes that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
The role of the assertion that participating in competitive athletics may increase strength and coordination is mentioned as a possible benefit, but it is not the main reason the teacher is arguing against eliminating funding.

Now, let's look at each answer choice to find the most similar flawed reasoning:
A. This choice follows the same flawed reasoning. It assumes that if most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes, then some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes must not be scholars. This is the most similar to the original argument.
B. This choice does not follow the same reasoning. It makes an unwarranted generalization about voters based on the behavior of politicians.
C. This choice makes an overgeneralization. It assumes that if some corporations only feign concern for the environment, then no corporation has a genuine concern, which is not a valid conclusion.
D. This choice does not follow the same reasoning. It suggests that some decisions should be made without regard for parents' wishes based on the fact that some parents show no interest in school curricula.
E. This choice does not follow the same reasoning. It concludes that even badly managed companies will usually turn a profit based on the fact that only a small percentage of profits are directly attributable to good management decisions.

","Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. The principle illustrated in the argument is that if evidence is obtained illegally, it cannot be used to justifiably punish someone, even if they admit to wrongdoing.
2. Choice A: This illustrates the principle. Even though Price confessed, Long was not justified in stealing from him in retaliation, as that is an illegal action.
3. Choice B: This does not illustrate the principle. Shakila's past actions do not make reporting her secretary's illegal actions unjustified.
4. Choice C: This does not illustrate the principle. Takashi's past curfew violation does not make Sarah's parents unjustified in punishing her for sneaking out.
5. Choice D: This illustrates the principle. Even though Kuttner admitted to setting illegal traps, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish him because the evidence was obtained through trespassing, which is illegal.
6. Choice E: This does not illustrate the principle. The board's past pardons of others do not make punishing Ramirez unjustified, as there is no mention of illegally obtained evidence.
Therefore, the best answer is choice D, as it most closely illustrates the principle from the original argument.

A: If the mass of galaxies makes up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass, then even a large increase in the number of galaxies would have little impact on the total mass estimate. This directly explains the situation.
B: The difficulty in estimating the mass of distant galaxies doesn't explain why the total mass estimate is unchanged. Even rough estimates of the additional galaxies' mass would likely increase the total.
C: The increasing number of galaxies discovered with better instruments is tangential to the question of why the mass estimate is unchanged despite the discovery of more galaxies.
D: The relationship between galaxy formation theories and the universe's total mass is not directly relevant to explaining the unchanged mass estimate.
E: A lack of consensus on estimating the universe's total mass doesn't explain why the estimate is unchanged despite finding more galaxies.

The argument states that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town, and the average citizen is more likely to become a victim of a violent crime. The evidence provided is that law enforcement agencies have responded to 17% more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year.
Choice A: A slight rise in the overall crime rate does not directly weaken the argument about violent crime specifically.
Choice B: The likelihood of being a victim based on age does not address the argument about the increase in violent crime.
Choice C: If more people are willing to report violent crimes due to community outreach programs, this could explain the 17% increase in calls to law enforcement. It weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in reported violent crimes, rather than an actual increase in violent crime occurrences.
Choice D: The opening of a community center for teenagers does not directly address the argument about the increase in violent crime.

Premise 1: Acquiring complete detailed information about a product's pros and cons is difficult and expensive.
Premise 2: It's rational not to acquire such information unless the expected benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty.
Conclusion: Consumers who don't bother to acquire such information are behaving rationally.
The conclusion assumes that the consumers who don't acquire the information are doing so because they don't expect the benefits to outweigh the costs. This matches choice E.
Choices A and D are close but don't quite fit. They state what rational consumers usually do or expect, but the conclusion is about the specific consumers who don't acquire the information.

Larew argues that the lowest income quintile's economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile because their average income increased by a higher percentage.
Mendota counters that even though the lowest quintile's average income increased by a greater percentage, the absolute amount of the increase was likely greater for the highest quintile.
The key point of disagreement is whether the relative change in economic prosperity should be measured by comparing the percentage changes in average income or the absolute amounts of the increases.
Larew believes comparing the percentage changes is the appropriate measure, while Mendota thinks the absolute amounts of the increases are more relevant.

3. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to find a reason why recycling projects, despite reducing garbage, could still lead to more overall environmental damage.
4. Looking at the choices:
   A. This choice suggests recycling causes less pollution than incineration, which doesn't explain the inconsistency.

2. The editorial assumes that holding both these views is inconsistent.

The main flaw in this argument is that it assumes causation based on correlation. Just because nervousness and anxiety are correlated with high blood pressure does not necessarily mean that these traits cause high blood pressure. There could be other factors at play, such as genetics or lifestyle choices, that contribute to both the personality traits and high blood pressure.

2. The evidence provided is that travelers who don't know the local language hear an uninterrupted stream of sound instead of distinct words.
The argument assumes that the travelers' perception of the unfamiliar language as an uninterrupted stream of sound is more accurate than the native speakers' perception of distinct words.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. The argument doesn't assume that understanding is impossible if sentences are uninterrupted streams of sound.
B. The argument doesn't make any assumptions about the actual sound of the language, only the perception of it.
C. The argument doesn't compare the attention paid by native speakers and non-native speakers.
D. The argument doesn't discuss the perceptions of accomplished non-native speakers.
E. This choice matches the assumption that the travelers' perception is more accurate than the native speakers' perception.

  E: If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else.
","Let's analyze Smith's statements and see which view they most directly support:
1. Smith acknowledges that children's interests are not always the same as their parents', and that government deficits can affect children's future standard of living.
2. However, Smith argues that children's conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults.
3. Therefore, Smith concludes that we cannot give children the responsibility of voting.
Smith's argument essentially states that while children's interests may differ from their parents', they are not capable of making informed voting decisions due to their limited understanding and different time horizons. This implies that the limitations on full democracy resulting from denying children the right to vote must be accepted.

","Let's analyze the journalist's argument step-by-step:
1. The journalist argues that the physician's critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
2. The journalist bases this on the fact that the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug, and therefore probably has personal reasons to deny the drug is dangerous.
3. The journalist assumes that because the physician has a connection to the drug company, his critique cannot be unbiased or legitimate.
4. However, this reasoning fails to consider that even if someone has personal reasons to deny a claim, they may still provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. Personal bias does not automatically invalidate an argument.
5. The journalist's argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that the physician's association with the drug company necessarily means his critique is invalid, without considering the actual merits of the physician's arguments.
Therefore, the reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds stated in choice D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.

","To determine which choice most accurately describes Rossi's argument, let's break it down:
1. Rossi states a general principle: ""It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented.""
2. Rossi then applies this principle to children, arguing that they should have the right to vote because their interests sometimes differ from their parents' interests.
Rossi's argument relies on a general principle and applies it to a specific case. The argument does not:
- Deny the good faith of an opponent (B)
- Evaluate the predictable consequences of a proposal (C)
- Substitute description for giving a rationale for a policy (D)
- Employ a term on two different occasions in different senses (E)

  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
","To determine which choice most seriously weakens the argument, let's first identify the argument's main points:
1. University libraries spend a significant portion of their acquisition budget on scholarly journal subscriptions.
2. The average subscription rate for libraries has increased dramatically in recent years.
3. The costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.
4. Therefore, publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Now, let's examine each choice to see which one, if true, would weaken the argument:
A. This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
B. This choice is also irrelevant to the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
C. This choice supports the argument by suggesting that publishers need to make a profit to survive.
D. If most subscribers are individuals and their subscription rates have remained unchanged, this suggests that the increased profitability of publishing scholarly journals may not be as significant as the argument claims. Libraries, which have seen dramatic increases in subscription rates, may represent a smaller portion of the subscriber base than assumed.
E. This choice is irrelevant to the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.
Among the given choices, D is the only one that weakens the argument by providing information that contradicts the assumption that the increased library subscription rates have led to a significant increase in the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.

3. Therefore, we should not conclude the speech was inflammatory solely based on Riley's testimony.
4. Unless there are independent reasons to deem the speech inflammatory, it is not true that the speech was inappropriate.
The argument concludes that the speech was not inappropriate unless there are independent reasons to deem it inflammatory, apart from Riley's testimony. This takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate for reasons other than being inflammatory.

1. The passage discusses a situation where a group is unable to reach consensus and members accuse each other of being stubborn or unyielding.
2. It suggests that if someone wants to make such an accusation, they should use the term ""unyielding"" because it can be proven by the fact that the person has not yielded.
3. This is a form of argument where if you accept the premise (that the person has not yielded), you must accept the conclusion (that they are unyielding).

B) This makes a similar flawed assumption - that because John's family members who don't own cars can't drive, and John doesn't own a car, then John can't drive. This doesn't consider that John might be an exception.
C) This doesn't make the same type of assumption. It logically links being able to drive and going to school to driving to school.

A. This doesn't fully capture the critic's reasoning, which is based on the nature of the reviewed objects, not the writer's portrayal.
B. This aligns with the critic's statement that objects must reveal important cultural truths to be the subject of criticism. It provides a criterion for what can be considered criticism.
C. The critic's argument is about the nature of the reviewed objects, not the writer's purpose.
D. The writer's self-identification is not mentioned in the critic's argument.

2. Future archaeologists studying the site might be misled by the absence of the mosaics, especially if they don't have access to the current records.

3. However, it states that individuals cannot easily adopt these strategies themselves unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.
4. This implies that people cannot easily deceive themselves, which is why they need a third party to provide the deceptive warning.
5. Among the given choices, option D directly states this assumption: ""People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.""
The other choices, while possibly true, are not necessary assumptions for the argument to hold. The argument does not rely on people believing everything doctors say, the techniques for quitting smoking being applicable to other habits, the degree of exaggeration affecting the likelihood of breaking a habit, or the justification of a doctor's deception.

","To explain why smokers of both low and high-nicotine cigarettes have the same blood nicotine levels, we need to find a choice that accounts for this finding.
A: This could explain the finding, as it suggests there is a maximum daily nicotine absorption limit that even low-nicotine cigarettes reach. However, it doesn't fully explain why high-nicotine smokers don't have higher levels.
B: If low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, they could end up absorbing as much nicotine as high-nicotine cigarette smokers. This helps explain the equal nicotine levels.
C: This choice suggests most nicotine gets absorbed regardless of quantity, but it doesn't explain why low and high-nicotine smokers end up with the same levels. More information is needed.
D and E: The tar levels and nicotine elimination rates do not help explain the similar absorption finding between low and high-nicotine smokers.
Therefore, B is the best explanation - low-nicotine smokers likely smoke more cigarettes to compensate, ending up with the same nicotine levels as high-nicotine smokers.

   a) Important problems can only be addressed by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes, and
   b) Such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action.
2. The argument concludes that the decreasing voter turnout is entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.
3. The argument assumes that the belief mentioned in point 1 is the sole cause of decreasing voter turnout, without considering other possible factors.

2. In countries where information is controlled, the majority of the population is denied vital information about factors determining their welfare.
3. The argument concludes that these countries with controlled information are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries.

1. The researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries, based on the observation that the group of joggers who stretched had roughly the same number of injuries as the group that did not stretch.
2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for the similar injury rates, or suggests that stretching could still be beneficial despite the observed results.
3. Choice A doesn't weaken the argument, as it just states that the overall injury rate was lower than usual for both groups. This doesn't affect the comparison between the two groups.
4. Choice B suggests that previously injured joggers had difficulty stretching. This doesn't directly address the effectiveness of stretching for injury prevention.
5. Choice C states that most jogging injuries are from falls or collisions, which stretching wouldn't prevent. This weakens the argument by suggesting that the similar injury rates could be due to the types of injuries being unaffected by stretching.
6. Choice D suggests that injury-prone joggers are more likely to stretch. This weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the results: the stretching group may have been more injury-prone to begin with, and stretching may have helped them achieve an injury rate similar to the less injury-prone non-stretchers.

","To determine which choice is least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn, let's consider each choice and its relevance to the conclusion.
The conclusion states that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the study results showing that Group A (older adults) had fewer lapses in remembering to make a phone call at a specified time compared to Group B (college students).
A: If the groups had different numbers of people, it could affect the comparison of lapses between the two groups. Having the same number of people in each group helps establish a fair comparison.
B: The group of researchers answering the calls should not impact the participants' ability to remember to make the calls at the specified time.
C: Knowing that there were no persons over 40 years old in the college student group helps establish that the two groups had distinct age ranges, which is important for comparing memory performance between older and younger individuals.
D: Both groups having unrestricted access to telephones is important to ensure that any lapses were due to memory issues and not external factors like lack of phone access.
E: Receiving instructions at approximately the same time before the calls helps ensure that both groups had a similar amount of time to remember the task, which is important for a fair comparison.
Among these choices, B is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The group of researchers answering the calls does not directly impact the participants' memory performance or the comparison between the two age groups.

","Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The argument states that human tears contain hormones that the body produces during emotional stress.
2. Shedding tears removes these hormones from the body.
3. The argument concludes that crying must reduce emotional stress.
The argument assumes that because tears contain stress hormones, shedding tears is sufficient to reduce emotional stress. However, it overlooks the possibility that the reduction in stress, if it occurs, might be due to factors other than the removal of hormones through tears.
For example, the act of crying itself, regardless of the shedding of tears, might have a cathartic effect that reduces stress. Alternatively, the social support or empathy that people often receive when they cry could be the primary factor in reducing stress.
The argument confuses a condition that is necessary for the production of a phenomenon (the presence of stress hormones in tears) with a condition that is sufficient to cause that phenomenon (the reduction of stress).

1. The key information given is that the size of northern fur seals is a reliable indicator of their population levels. Specifically, the smaller the average body size, the larger the population.
2. Over the 800-year period studied, when the seals were hunted by Native peoples in North America, the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.
3. If the average body size didn't change significantly, it implies that the population level also didn't change significantly during this period.

1. The argument states that people often tell us to learn the lessons of history.
2. However, the argument points out that it's nearly impossible to discover what these lessons are, even if we could accurately determine what the past was like.
3. The argument uses the example of World War I, questioning what lessons we are supposed to learn from it.
4. It further states that even if we could discover these lessons, it's unclear if we could apply them, as we will never have a situation exactly like World War I again.
The argument seems to be directed toward discrediting the idea that we should learn the lessons of history. It does this by pointing out the difficulties in determining what those lessons are and the challenges in applying them to different situations.
Therefore, the statement ""we should learn the lessons of history"" is used in the argument in a way that expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.

  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are
","To evaluate the argument, we need to consider what additional information would help assess the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to someone in that neighborhood.
The argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in all other neighborhoods combined, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights likely belongs to someone there. However, this assumes the registration data accurately reflects the actual distribution of cocker spaniels.
Knowing whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods would be most useful. If Flynn Heights residents are more diligent about licensing, the registration data may overstate the proportion of cocker spaniels that actually reside there. In that case, a stray cocker spaniel found nearby may be less likely to belong to a Flynn Heights resident than the licensing data suggests.
The other choices, while relevant, don't directly address the potential bias in the licensing data, which is key to evaluating the argument's reasoning.

2. We need to find the principle that best justifies this reasoning.
3. Option A is not correct because the passage does not compare the number of counterintuitive consequences of quantum theory with its competitors.
4. Option B aligns with the reasoning in the passage. The passage states that despite rigorous attempts to show quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate. This suggests that the theory has withstood serious attempts to disprove it.
5. Option C is not correct because the passage does not suggest that the consequences of quantum theory are not counterintuitive. In fact, it acknowledges that some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences.
6. Option D is not correct because the passage does not suggest that a theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it. The passage is arguing for acceptance of quantum theory, not against rejection of theories in general.
7. Option E is not correct because the passage does not suggest that a theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved. The passage argues for acceptance of quantum theory based on the accuracy of its predictions, not merely the lack of disproof.

The flaw in this reasoning is that it assumes that having the right to do something means having an obligation to do it. Just because the press has the right to publish non-libelous stories about private individuals doesn't necessarily mean they are obligated to do so.
The argument jumps from ""the press has a right to publish"" to ""the press has an obligation to publish"" without justifying that leap in logic.

","To determine the assumption the argument depends on, let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The argument states that traditional ""talk"" therapy produces chemical changes in the brain that correspond to improvements in the patient's behavior.
2. Based on this, the argument concludes that physicians will eventually be able to treat patients as effectively through direct pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through traditional ""talk"" methods.
3. For this conclusion to be valid, the argument must assume that the chemical changes in the brain are the sole cause of the improvements in the patient's behavior. In other words, it assumes that there are no other factors involved in the effectiveness of ""talk"" therapy besides the chemical changes.
4. This assumption is best captured by choice B: ""improvements in a patient's behavior produced by 'talk' therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.""

- Choice A is too broad and not specifically related to the argument.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be regulated to protect wildlife, by requiring replacement wetlands to be constructed to offset any development.
2. The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has conserved its wetlands while other nations have developed theirs, so Figoria should be allowed to develop its wetlands for economic growth, especially since it might not affect wildlife.
3. We need to find the principle that most strongly supports the Development Commission's position against the Wildlife Commission's position.
4. Choice C states that regulation should only be implemented when it's found that development has actually reduced endangered species populations. This aligns with the Development Commission's argument that Figorian development might not affect wildlife and should be allowed.

   - A and B suggest international regulation and prioritizing wildlife preservation, which goes against the Development Commission's stance.
   - D argues against allowing different degrees of environmental harm by different nations, contrary to the Development Commission's point.

","Let's analyze the reasoning in the original argument:
1. A diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat protein.
2. However, if everyone adopted this diet, the marine species it relies on would go extinct.
3. Therefore, we should not recommend universal adoption of this diet.
The key points are:
- Something is beneficial on an individual level
- But if everyone did it, it would lead to unsustainable consequences
- So we shouldn't recommend it for everyone
Now let's look at the answer choices:
A: This is about potential safety issues with vitamin E supplements, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone took them. The reasoning is different.
B: This is about potential consequences of high tobacco taxes, but not in the same way as the original argument. It's not about everyone doing something unsustainable.
C: This closely matches the original reasoning:
- Limiting purchases to needs and saving/investing the rest is good for an individual
- But if everyone did this, it would severely damage the economy, making saving/investing impossible
- So we shouldn't recommend this spending pattern to everyone
The reasoning is very similar to the original argument.
D: This is about legislators campaigning vs doing their jobs, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone did something. The reasoning is different.
E: This is weighing pros and cons of restricting wilderness development, not about unsustainable consequences if everyone did something. The reasoning is different.

1. The passage begins by stating that many people assume personal conflicts are inevitable, but that this assumption is incorrect. 
2. It then provides the main reason why the author believes this assumption is wrong: personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational.
3. The author provides an example of this irrationality: people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones, even when there is more evidence of the good qualities.
4. The passage concludes by contrasting how easily a suspicion of unreliability can turn into certainty, versus how long it takes to build up a belief in someone's reliability.

  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
","To determine the required assumption, let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. Acme Corporation is moving from Milltown to Ocean View.
2. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
3. After the move, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
The argument concludes that most employees will have a longer commute after the move. For this to be true, we must assume that the employees currently have a shorter commute. Otherwise, the move wouldn't necessarily result in a longer commute for most employees.
Looking at the answer choices:
A. This is not necessary to assume. The argument is about the commute time, not affordability.
B. The chairperson's reasons are not relevant to the conclusion about employee commute times.
C. Employee opinions are not mentioned and are not necessary for the conclusion.
D. This is the required assumption. If most employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes, then the move to Ocean View would result in a longer commute for most employees.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument states that using cotton fiber instead of nylon to make products like thread and rope would cause less environmental damage, because processing cotton doesn't release harmful nitrous oxide gas like nylon manufacturing does.
2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that suggests using cotton fiber might not actually reduce environmental damage compared to using nylon.
3. Choice A doesn't affect the argument, as it just says other environmental problems would still exist even if nitrous oxide decreased. It doesn't compare the impact of cotton vs nylon.
4. Choice B actually supports the argument by saying that even partially replacing nylon with cotton would avoid some damage. 
5. Choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that if cotton replaced nylon in thread and rope, more nylon would be used in other products. This implies the overall nylon production and thus nitrous oxide release might not decrease.
6. Choice D supports the argument by saying reducing nylon production would reduce pollutants. It doesn't introduce any downside to using cotton instead.
7. Choice E is irrelevant, as the argument is about reducing damage by replacing nylon with cotton. The growth rate of cotton production isn't a factor.

  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.
  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.
  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.
  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Ditalgame is introducing a new copy protection feature to combat piracy of its video games.
2. The president predicts this will lead to a substantial increase in sales.
3. We need to find the choice that best supports this prediction.
Now, let's examine each choice:
A: The fact that Ditalgame spent a lot on developing the feature and needs to recoup costs doesn't necessarily mean the feature will be effective and lead to increased sales.
B: The shrinking market share suggests Ditalgame has other issues beyond piracy. This doesn't support the prediction that the anti-piracy feature alone will boost sales substantially.
C: If the copy protection allows people to play the game long enough to enjoy it and want to buy it, this could indeed lead to increased sales as the president predicts.
D: Favorable reviews might encourage more piracy, but don't directly support the prediction that the copy protection will boost sales.
E: This choice is incomplete, but even if Ditalgame games are copied more than others, it doesn't mean the new feature will necessarily reduce that and increase sales.
Choice C provides the most direct support for the president's prediction. If the copy protection itself encourages people to buy the game after trying it, sales are likely to increase.

  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that until 1985, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes. After 1985, it was changed to every hour.
2. It also states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished, the higher the level of carbon dioxide and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to spread.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) The passage doesn't mention regulations, so this isn't strongly supported.
B) This is supported. If cabin air is replenished less frequently now, it's easier for airborne illnesses to spread, so people are more likely to contract them.
C) The passage suggests the opposite - low levels of carbon dioxide make it harder, not impossible, for airborne illnesses to spread.
D) The passage doesn't provide information about whether the 1980 rate was sufficient to protect passengers.
E) This is supported. In 1980, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes, leading to lower carbon dioxide levels than today's hourly replenishment.
4. Both B and E are supported by the passage, but E is more directly stated, while B requires an inference about the likelihood of contracting illnesses.

  D: She advances the claim that a campaign such as Yuriko recommends is not necessary because most parents already choose to have their children vaccinated.
  E: She presents evidence to suggest that vaccination campaigns are usually ineffective.
","Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. Yuriko claims that the vaccination campaign led to a 30% increase in vaccinations over 16 months, and recommends that Susan's city should imitate this campaign.
2. Susan counters by pointing out that most of the increase occurred in the first 6 months, right after the city's free neighborhood health clinics opened, and before the vaccination campaign really got going.
3. By providing this information, Susan is suggesting that the increase in vaccinations may be more attributable to the opening of the free health clinics than to the vaccination campaign.
4. This tends to weaken Yuriko's argument that the vaccination campaign was responsible for the increase, and that Susan's city should imitate it.
5. Susan is not denying that her city wants to increase vaccination rates (Choice A), introducing evidence that the campaign is only effective for a short time (Choice C), claiming that a campaign is unnecessary (Choice D), or suggesting that vaccination campaigns are usually ineffective (Choice E).

3. Despite this, the person usually constructs a coherent and ingenious dream narrative.

  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.
  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
2. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
3. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
4. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
A. This is not supported. The passage does not state that all objects without lithium are stars with less mass than the Sun. Brown dwarfs could potentially have no lithium for other reasons.
B. This is not supported. The passage states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium due to incomplete mixing, but it does not say that all objects with lithium have incompletely mixed nuclear furnaces.
C. This is strongly supported. The passage states that brown dwarfs do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces, so their lithium cannot be consumed. Therefore, if an object has no lithium, it cannot be a brown dwarf.
D. This is not supported. The passage does not make any claims about all objects with lithium being more massive than the Sun.
E. This is not supported. The passage does not discuss objects less massive than brown dwarfs.

1. The ancient Egyptian earthenware hippopotamus was found in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off.
2. Ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts.
3. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war.
4. The curator concludes that the hippopotamus was a religious object, not a toy.

Looking at the answer choices:
A. The age of the tomb's occupant is not relevant to the argument.
B. This is not necessary for the argument, as the hippopotamus could have been a religious object even if some earthenware figures were used as toys.
C. The tomb being undisturbed until archaeologists opened it is not required for the argument.

","Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:
1. The main conclusion of the argument is that recent proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.
2. The argument provides two main reasons to support this conclusion:
   a) Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers.
   b) Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains.
3. The argument then provides further support for reason (b) by stating:
   - Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly.
   - If airline passengers are offended by cell-phone use, they often cannot move to another seat.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) It is not the main conclusion, as the main conclusion is about proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes being ill-advised.
B) The argument is not trying to rebut this claim, but rather uses it to support the main conclusion.
C) It does not indirectly support the main conclusion by supporting another premise.
D) This accurately describes the role of the statement. It is a conclusion that cell-phone use would be more upsetting on airplanes, which is supported by the premises about airline passengers being packed tightly and not being able to move seats. This conclusion is then used to directly support the main conclusion.
E) It is not merely background information, as it plays a key role in the reasoning of the argument.
Therefore, the best answer is (D).

  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do
","Let's analyze the argument and each answer choice:
The argument essentially states that technological innovation doesn't benefit society because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit, as evidenced by their focus on developing commercially viable technology.
A: The premise that innovators are almost always motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit is a generalization, but not impossible.
B: This is a strong point. The argument does seem to assume that commercially viable technology can't also be beneficial to society, which is not necessarily true.
C: The argument is not about whether the innovators actually achieve personal gain, but rather about their motivations.
D: This is also a good point. The argument assumes that because the innovators are not primarily motivated by benefiting society, their innovations won't benefit society. But an action can have unintended positive consequences even if that wasn't the main motivation.
E: The argument does make a claim about practical consequences (technology not benefiting society) based on assumptions about motivations, so this criticism seems less relevant.
Both B and D point out flaws in the argument's assumptions, but B seems to more directly address the core of the argument about the relationship between commercial viability and societal benefit.

  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The professor's argument is that freedom of thought alone is not sufficient for intellectual progress. Intellectual discipline is also necessary to fully explore interrelated ideas.
2. The conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought (as a precondition for intellectual progress) fails.
3. For this conclusion to logically follow, there must be an assumption that links the premise (intellectual discipline is necessary) to the conclusion (the argument for freedom of thought fails).
4. Looking at the choices:
   A. This doesn't directly link to the conclusion about freedom of thought.
   B. This is not directly relevant to the argument.
   C. If this were assumed, it would logically connect the premise to the conclusion. If freedom of thought necessarily leads to a lack of intellectual discipline, and intellectual discipline is necessary for progress, then freedom of thought would not be sufficient for progress.
   D. This goes against the professor's argument.
   E. This is the reverse of what the professor is arguing.
Therefore, the assumption that makes the professor's conclusion follow logically is C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.

Choices:
  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.
  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.
  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.

  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.
  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.
","To strengthen the argument that lawmakers consider the harm from theft equal to the harm from bribery, we need to find a choice that supports the link between the penalties mandated and the lawmakers' assessment of the resulting harm.
A: This choice directly supports the argument by stating that lawmakers generally mandate penalties proportional to the harm they believe results from the crimes. If theft and bribery have the same penalty, lawmakers likely consider their harms to be equal.
B: While this choice suggests lawmakers consider harm in criminalizing acts, it doesn't directly address the relationship between penalties and perceived harm.
C: This choice weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the equal penalties - that they could be a response to a particular instance rather than a general assessment of the crimes' harms.
D: The relative harm to victims doesn't necessarily reflect lawmakers' views on the overall societal harm of the crimes.
E: The deterrent effect of proportional penalties is not directly relevant to whether lawmakers view theft and bribery as equally harmful.
Therefore, choice A most strengthens the argument.
