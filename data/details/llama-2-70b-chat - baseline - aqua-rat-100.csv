  E:  20.8888
","  Let's first determine the volume of the rectangular solid.
Volume = Length × Width × Height
Volume = 3 × 4 × 15
Volume = 60

Since the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the solid.

We can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:
V = (4/3)πr³

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Now, we can set up the equation:
(4/3)πr³ = 60

We can solve for r:
r³ = (60/(4/3)) = 3^3 = 27
r = 3

Now, we can find the diameter of the sphere:
diameter = 2r = 2(3) = 6

So, the diameter of the sphere is 6.

Action: Answer(""E"")","In an inscribed rectangle in a sphere, we will have a line joining the opposite vertices as the diameter.
According to the Pythagoras theorem, sides 3, 4 give diagonal as 5 ==> with 5 and 15, we get 5sqrt(10).
5sqrt(10) or 15.8113 is the diameter of the sphere.

1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.
2. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck.
3. To find the weight of the new truck, we can use the formula for finding the new average:

New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)

In this case, the change in weight is 2.6 tons, and the number of items has increased by 1 (the new truck).

New average = 12.2 + (2.6 / 11)

New average = 12.2 + 0.236

New average = 12.436

Since the new average is 12.436 tons, the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new average and the old average:

Weight of new truck = New average - Old average

Weight of new truck = 12.436 - 12.2

Weight of new truck = 0.236 tons

Now, we can check our choices:

A: 40.8
B: 41.6
C: 42.2

The yearly profit is 5,040 units x (X - $110) = 5,040 units x ($X - $110).

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need 5,040 units x ($X - $110) >= 626,400.

Simplifying, we get:

X - $110 >= 626,400/5,040

X - $110 >= 124.8

X >= 110 + 124.8

X >= 234.8

Since X is a selling price, it must be a whole number.
The closest whole number to 234.8 is 230.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $230.

Action: Answer(""B"")","450*12(x-110)=626400

","  Let's first calculate the average speed of the jeep during the forward journey.

Time = Distance / Speed

6 hours = Distance / Speed

Speed = Distance / 6 hours

Now, we know that the jeep increased its speed by 12 km/hr during the return journey. So, the average speed during the return journey would be:

Average Speed during return journey = Speed + 12 km/hr

Now, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

4 hours = Distance / (Speed + 12 km/hr)

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of Speed:

4 hours = Distance / (Distance / 6 hours + 12 km/hr)

Simplifying further:

4 hours = Distance / (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6 + 12 km/hr)

Distance = 4 hours \* (1/6) + 4 hours \* (12 km/hr)

Distance = 4/6 + 48 km

Distance = 1/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1.5/1.5 + 48 km

Distance = 1 + 48 km

Distance = 49 km

Therefore, the distance traveled by the jeep is 49 km.

We know that the total number of boys in the group is 64 + 4x, and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + 3x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation:
(64 + 4x) / (40 + 3x) = 4/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:
4x = 120

Now, we can find the value of x:
x = 120/4
x = 30

So, the number of boys who joined the group is 4x = 4(30) = 120.
The number of girls who joined the group is 3x = 3(30) = 90.

","  Let's assume the number of hours Alex works be x.
Since both Alex and Jacob work for almost a similar number of hours, the number of hours Jacob works is also x.

We know that Alex makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.
Similarly, Jacob makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.

Since both Alex and Jacob work for the same number of hours, the total number of toys they make is the sum of their individual toy-making rates:
35/x + 35/x = 70/x

Now, we want to find out how many toys Jacob makes. We can set up the following equation:
70/x = 9(35)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 70/9
x = 7.78

Since Jacob works for 9 hours, the number of toys he makes is:
35/x = 35/7.78 = 4.55

So, Jacob makes 4 toys less than Alex. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.

=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

1. The average of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x.
2. The average score for the entire class is equal to y.
3. There are z students in the class, where z > 5.

We can start by finding the sum of the scores. Let's say the highest score is H and the lowest score is L. Then, the sum of all z scores can be represented as:
S = H + L + (z - 2) \* (y - H/2)

We know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so we can write:
x = (H + L)/2

We also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so we can write:
y = (S)/z

Now, we want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. We can do this by subtracting the highest and lowest scores from the sum and then dividing by the number of scores remaining:
Average = (S - H - L)/(z - 2)

Now, we can substitute the expressions we derived earlier:
Average = [(H + L + (z - 2) \* (y - H/2)) - H - L]/ (z - 2)

1. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.
2. We can use the formula tan(θ) = h/d, where θ is the angle of elevation, h is the height of the tower, and d is the distance from the car to the tower.
3. We know that the angle of elevation changes by 15° (60° - 45° = 15°) in 10 minutes.
4. We can use the fact that the angle of elevation changes by 15° to find the rate at which the angle of elevation changes: 15°/10 minutes = 1.5° per minute.
5. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°: d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.
6. We can use the fact that the angle of elevation changes by 1.5° per minute to find the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°: time = 15°/1.5° per minute = 10 minutes.
7. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°: d = h/tan(60°) = h/√3.
8. We can use the fact that the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° is equal to the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° to find the height of the tower: h = d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.
9. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower: d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.
10. We can use the fact that the car is moving at a uniform speed to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower: time = distance/speed = h/1/speed.

Action: Answer(""E"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)

1. The servant's monthly salary is 1500.
2. The servant is also paid a 15% commission on the monthly sale.
3. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.

To find the required sale, we need to first find the commission earned by the servant.

Commission = Monthly sale x Commission percentage
Commission = Monthly sale x 15%
Commission = Monthly sale x 0.15

Now, we can set up an equation using the information given:

Monthly salary + Commission = Monthly income
1500 + Commission = 6000

We can solve for the commission:

Commission = 6000 - 1500
Commission = 4500

Now, we can use the equation we set up earlier to solve for the monthly sale:

Monthly sale = Commission / Commission percentage
Monthly sale = 4500 / 0.15
Monthly sale = 30,000

Therefore, the servant should do a sale of 30,000 rupees to get a monthly income of 6000 rupees.

90% of the rest (which means 90% - 10% = 80%) are squashed.
So, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is 20%.
Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

2. In the finals, he scores 78 runs.
3. His new batting average will be 54.

We can use the formula for finding the average to solve this problem:
average = (sum of all values)/(number of values)

We know that Sachin's current average is 51, so the sum of all values is 51*x, where x is the number of matches he has played.

After the finals, his average becomes 54, so the sum of all values becomes 54*x + 78.

Each small cube has 6 faces, and each face has an area of 1^2 = 1 square centimeter.
The number of small cubes on the surface of the outer cube is 300/1 = 300.
Since each small cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces on the surface of the outer cube is 300*6 = 1800.
Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, all the faces of the small cubes on the surface are painted.
The number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted is 6*5^2 - 1800 = 500.

1. 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
2. 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

We can start by finding the number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team:

24% of all students = 0.24 x 100 = 24 students

Now, let's find the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club:

20% of members of the swim team = 0.20 x 24 = 4.8

Since 4.8 is not a whole number, we'll round up to 5 students.

Now, let's find the total number of students who are members of the swim team:

Total number of students who are members of the swim team = Number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team + Number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club
= 24 + 5 = 29

Finally, we can find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:

4. To find the total deer population, we need to use the proportion of deer with tags in the second-year sample and apply it to the total number of deer caught in the first year.
5. The proportion of deer with tags in the second-year sample is 20/500 = 0.04.
6. To find the total deer population, we can multiply the proportion by the number of deer caught in the first year: 0.04 x 300 = 12.

","  Let's assume the speed of the ship to be 's' and the speed of the plane to be 'ps', where p is 10.
The distance traveled by the ship is given as 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane is given as x miles.

We know that the plane starts 180 miles away from the starting point of the ship, so the distance between the ship and the plane at any given time is:
x - 180

Since the plane is traveling at 10 times the speed of the ship, the time it takes for the plane to cover the distance between the ship and the plane is:
(x - 180) / (ps - s)

We want to find the distance when they meet, so we set up the equation:
(x - 180) / (ps - s) = 1

Now, we can solve for x:
x - 180 = (ps - s)
x = (ps - s) + 180

Substituting the values, we get:
x = (10s - s) + 180
x = 9s + 180

Now, we have to find the value of s. We know that the ship traveled 180 miles in some time, let's call it t.
So, the distance traveled by the ship is:
180 = st

Now, we can solve for s:
s = 180 / t

Substituting the value of s in the equation of x, we get:
x = 9(180 / t) + 180
x = 180(9/t) + 180
x = 180(1 + 9/t)

Now, we have to find the value of x. We know that the plane meets the ship after traveling 289 miles.
So, we can set up the equation:
180(1 + 9/t) = 289

Now, we can solve for t:
t = 9/10

Substituting the value of t in the equation of x, we get:
x = 180(1 + 9/9/10)
x = 180(1 + 10/9)
x = 180(11/9)
x = 200

So, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 200 miles.

2. The length of line segment ST is 22. Therefore, the distance between S and T is 22/2 = 11.
3. Since R is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between R and S is equal to the distance between R and T.
4. The distance between R and S is 5, and the distance between R and T is 17 - 5 = 12.

To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y.
Let the amount of zinc in alloy X be 6x grams and the amount of copper be 9x grams.
Let the amount of zinc in alloy Y be 7y grams and the amount of copper be 11y grams.
When 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total amount of zinc is 6x + 7y grams, and the total amount of copper is 9x + 11y grams.
We can set up a proportion to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:
(6x + 7y) / (9x + 11y) = (zinc in Z) / (copper in Z)

We can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:
6x + 7y = 9x + 11y

Subtracting 7y from both sides gives us:
6x = 2y

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:
x = 2y/6

Substituting y = 11y/7 from the second equation, we get:
x = 2(11y/7) / 6

Simplifying, we get:
x = 11y/14

Now, we can find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:
Ratio of zinc in Z = 6x = 6(11y/14) = 11y/2

Ratio of copper in Z = 9x = 9(11y/14) = 11y/2

Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 11y/2:11y/2, which simplifies to 1:1.

We know that x = 91, so we can find x by solving the system of equations:

","  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Initially, the bag contains 3200 white marbles.
2. 20 marbles are pulled out, painted black, and put back in. Now, there are 3180 white marbles and 20 black marbles.
3. Another 20 marbles are pulled out. Since 1 marble is black, there are 19 white marbles and 1 black marble, making the total number of marbles 3181.
4. All the marbles are returned to the bag, so the final number of marbles in the bag is 3181.

The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 5%. Since this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of 3181 = 159.

Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 3181 + 159 = 3340.

","  Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to reach B is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = B - A / 70

2. Since he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to return to A is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = A - B / 90

3. We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, we can set up the equation:

Time = 3 hours
Distance = 70 miles
Speed = 70 mph

Using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

We can solve for distance:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = 3 x 70
Distance = 210 miles

4. Since Kevin drove from A to B and then returned to A, the total distance traveled is twice the distance between A and B:

Total distance = 2 x Distance

2. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 months, which means the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10.
3. The sum of the ages of all members is 250.

The third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).
The fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).
The fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).

To find the range of x, we need to simplify the expression and determine the bounds of n.
Let's first simplify the expression:
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n(n + 4) + 16) / (n(n + 4) + 4)
x = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator and denominator have the same factors, so we can cancel them out:
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n2 + 4n + 8) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n + 2)2 / (n + 2)2
x = 2

Since n is between 36 and 72, n + 2 is between 38 and 74, and 2(n + 2)2 is between 76 and 148.
Therefore, x is between 2(76) = 152 and 2(148) = 296.

The closest choices to these bounds are:
A: 20 < x < 54 (too small)
B: 23 < x < 58 (too small)
C: 25 < x < 64 (too small)
D: 28 < x < 60 (too small)
E: None of these (correct, since none of the given ranges match the actual range of x)
Action: Answer(""E"")","36 ≤ n ≤ 72

","  Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.
Since there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.

There are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.

Since there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.

The total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.

The total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:

16x + 25x = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

41x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 41, we get:

x = 210

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.

","  Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners.
Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees.
The cost of W white sharpeners is W + 1 rupees, and the cost of B brown sharpeners is B rupees.
Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:
W + 1 + B = 100

We know that W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)

Substituting W + B = 18 into the first equation, we get:
W + 1 + B = 100
W + B = 18

Subtracting W from both sides of the second equation, we get:
B = 18 - W

Now, we can substitute this expression for B into the first equation:
W + 1 + (18 - W) = 100

Combine like terms:
2W + 1 = 100

Subtract 1 from both sides:
2W = 99

Divide both sides by 2:
W = 49.5

Since W is a whole number, W = 49.

Now, we can find B:
B = 18 - W
B = 18 - 49
B = -31

Since B cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution.

1. You walk 20 steps and stop; you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. You walk 10 steps and stop; you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

Now, let's analyze the information:

If you walk 20 steps and stop, you cover 20 steps in 10 minutes.
That means, in 1 minute, you cover 20/10 = 2 steps.

If you walk 10 steps and stop, you cover 10 steps in 20 minutes.
That means, in 1 minute, you cover 10/20 = 0.5 steps.

Now, we can calculate the speed of the elevator:

Speed = Distance / Time

In the first case, distance = 20 steps, time = 10 minutes = 10/60 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
So, speed = 20/10 = 2 steps/minute.

In the second case, distance = 10 steps, time = 20 minutes = 20/60 hours.
So, speed = 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute.

Since the speed of the elevator is constant, we can take the average of the two speeds:

Average speed = (2 steps/minute + 0.5 steps/minute) / 2 = 1.5 steps/minute.

3. We can calculate the cost for each mile by multiplying the number of quarter-miles by 10 cents and adding $3.50.
4. The maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is found by dividing $8.50 by the cost per mile.

Now, let's calculate the cost per mile:

1 quarter-mile = $3.50
2 quarter-miles = $3.50 + 10 cents = $3.60
3 quarter-miles = $3.60 + 10 cents = $3.70
4 quarter-miles = $3.70 + 10 cents = $3.80

1. Initially, the tea is 50% strong, meaning it has a concentration of 50%.
2. John replaces 15% of the tea with milk twice, which means he replaces 15% of the tea with milk once.

The concentration of the tea after the first time replacing 15% of it with milk is:

50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%

3. Now, John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.

The concentration of the tea after the second time replacing 10% of it with milk is:

42.5% - (10% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 4.25% = 38.25%

Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 38.25%.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea.

1. A starts a business with Rs.40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000.
3. C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.
4. The total investment now is Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000.
5. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.
6. C gets Rs.150,000 as his share.

Now, let's find the time at which C joined the business.

Profit share of C = Total profit x (C's investment / Total investment)

Profit share of C = Rs.375,000 x (Rs.120,000 / Rs.220,000)

Profit share of C = Rs.375,000 x 0.545

Profit share of C = Rs.199,750

Since C gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the difference between the profit share of C and the actual amount he gets is:

Rs.199,750 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.49,750

Now, we need to find the time at which C joined the business.

Let X be the number of months after B joined that C joined.

The investment of C = Rs.120,000

The profit share of C = Rs.199,750

The difference between the profit share of C and the actual amount he gets = Rs.49,750

We can set up the following equation:

Rs.120,000 x (1 + (X/12))^X = Rs.199,750

Simplifying the equation:

1 + (X/12)^X = 1.66125

(X/12)^X = 1.66125 - 1

(X/12)^X = 0.66125

X = 23

2. Let's call the breadth x. Then, the length is 4x + 1.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m.
4. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and breadth. So, we can set up the equation: (4x + 1)x = 150.
5. Simplifying the equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0.
6. Factoring the equation, we get (2x + 75)(2x - 6) = 0.
7. Solving for x, we get x = -75/2 or x = 6/2.
8. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we know that x = 6/2 = 3.
9. Now, we can find the length: 4x + 1 = 4(3) + 1 = 13.
