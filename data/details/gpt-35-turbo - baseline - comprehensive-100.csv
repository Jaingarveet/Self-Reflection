Solving the equation 1500 = 500 + 0.05x for x, we get x = 20000.
Answer(""D"")","Let S be the total monthly salary and x be the monthly sales, hence
S = 500 + 5% * x
Find sales x so that S = 1500, hence

","Thought:
The length of each picket is 1/2 inch.
The length of space between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.
To find the total length of the fence, we need to add the length of all the pickets and spaces.
There are x pickets and x-1 spaces between them.
The total length of the fence is (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6) inches.
We need to convert the answer to feet by dividing by 12.

Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket

We can use the formula: distance = speed x time
We need to find the speed of the space shuttle first.
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
The length of the space shuttle is the sum of the distances it covers during the 40 seconds and the 5 seconds.

","Thought:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
The age of the youngest member is 7 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.
The common difference is 3 months, which is 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members can be expressed as a function of n.
We can use these equations to solve for n.
Action: 
The sum of the ages of n members in an A.P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]
Here, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we have:
250 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
2000 = 4n[14 + (n-1)/4]
Expanding the brackets, we get:
2000 = 56n + n^2 - n
Simplifying this quadratic equation, we get:
n^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
n = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(2000)))/2
n = (-55 ± 85)/2
n = 15 or n = -70
Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 15.

Option A is incorrect because the passage only states that monstrous beast stories sometimes describe violations of the laws of nature, not all of them. 
Option C is incorrect because the passage only mentions that some stories about monstrous beasts use the monster as a symbol for a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. 
Option D is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, not that they are antiscientific. 
Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about symbolism.

The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.

We can expand the left side of the equation and compare the coefficients with the right side of the equation to find the values of $c$.
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2+(7a+2b)x+14$
Comparing the coefficients, we get:
$ab=15$ and $7a+2b=c$
We also know that $a+b=8$, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$.
Action: 
$ab=15$ and $a+b=8$ implies $a=3$ and $b=5$ or $a=5$ and $b=3$.
Substituting these values in $7a+2b=c$, we get $c=29$ or $c=11$.
Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 11 and 29. Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

","Thought:
If the line passes through the origin, then the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line.
The equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
If the line passes through the origin, then $(0,0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
Action: 
Substitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ in the equation of the line and solve for $k$.
$0-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(0-2)$
$-k=-2\frac{32-k}{k-2}$
$k(k-2)=2(k-32)$
$k^2-2k=2k-64$
$k^2-4k+64=0$
$(k-4)^2=0$
$k=4$
Answer: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$. Therefore, of the given choices, only 8 could be the value of $k$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and may be the result of computational errors.",B,C,0,308,198,506,

We can solve the system of equations by elimination method or substitution method to find the values of $x$ and $y$. Once we have the values of $x$ and $y$, we can find the value of $x-y$.
Action: 
Elimination method:
Multiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
$$5x=10$$
$$x=2$$
Substituting the value of $x$ in the first equation, we get:
$$2(2)-3y=-14$$
$$-3y=-18$$
$$y=6$$
Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
Answer: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Multiplying each side of the equation $2 x-3 y=-14$ by 3 gives $6 x-9 y=-42$. Multiplying each side of the equation $3 x-2 y=-6$ by 2 gives $6 x-4 y=-12$. Then, subtracting the sides of $6 x-4 y=-12$ from the corresponding sides of $6 x-9 y=-42$ gives $-5 y=-30$. Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is $2-6=-4$.Alternatively, adding the corresponding sides of $2 x-3 y=-14$ and $3 x-2 y=-6$ gives $5 x-5 y=-20$, from which it follows that $x-y=-4$.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are incorrect and may be the result of an arithmetic error when solving the system of equations.

","Thought:
If the population of City X was 120,000 in 2010, then in 2015 it would be:
$120,000 + 20\% \times 120,000 = 144,000$
Since the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, the population of City Y in 2015 would also be 144,000.
From 2010 to 2015, the population of City Y decreased by 10%, so the population of City Y in 2010 would be:
$\frac{144,000}{1-10\%} = \frac{144,000}{0.9} = 160,000$
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. It's given that the population of City $\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, and that it increased by $20 \%$ from 2010 to 2015 . Therefore, the population of City X in 2015 was $120,000(1+0.20)=144,000$. It's also given that the population of City $\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \%$ from 2010 to 2015. If $y$ represents the population of City $Y$ in 2010, then $y(1-0.10)=144,000$. Solving this equation for $y$ yields $y=\frac{144,000}{1-0.10}$.
