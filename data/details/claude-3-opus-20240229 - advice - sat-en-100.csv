Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$

","Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","Okay, let's carefully analyze the data in the table to determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder.
The table shows data for four pathogens: IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, and Nosema ceranae. 
For colonies without colony collapse disorder, the infection percentages are:
IAPV: 5%
KBV: 76% 
Nosema apis: 81%
Nosema ceranae: 0%
Looking at these percentages, Nosema apis infected 81% of colonies without colony collapse disorder, which is the highest of the four pathogens.
Therefore, based on the data presented in the table, Nosema apis infected the highest percentage of honey bee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",C,D,0,1545,186,1731,

  A: 0 percent

  D: 100 percent
","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The question is asking specifically about the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens together.
Looking at the data table, there is a row for ""All four pathogens"" under the ""Pathogen"" column. 
However, the percentage is not explicitly given for colonies with colony collapse disorder. The cell is blank.
The data shows 100% for some individual pathogens in collapse disorder colonies, but the limiting factor for all 4 occurring together would be the smallest individual percentage, which is 77% for Nosema ceranae.
Since the exact ""All four pathogens"" percentage is not stated, the correct percentage must be less than or equal to 77%. 
The only answer choice that fits this constraint is 0%.
Therefore, the data supports that 0 percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens together.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",A,B,0,1495,219,1714,

Choices:
  A: They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.
  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.

  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in Passage 1 regarding slavery and the Constitution seem to be:
1. The Constitution allowed for a Union ""divided into Free and Slave States"" from the beginning. 
2. Under this divided Union, the country has grown tremendously in population, territory, wealth and power.
3. The author believes this divided Union can continue to exist and expand ""if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors.""
4. The author sees continued expansion and acquisition of new territory as necessary for the growing nation, which the principle of ""State rights and State sovereignty"" will allow to happen indefinitely.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: The passage doesn't suggest the Constitution included no means for reconciling differences. In fact, it suggests letting each state do as it pleases is the way to allow the divided Union to continue. 
B: This seems supported by the passage's discussion of the need to ""expand and acquire new territory from time to time"" as the nation grows.
C: The author does argue the basic structure of the divided Union has worked well and can continue working if the principle of states' rights is followed, so this choice is plausible.
D: The passage doesn't tie slavery to economic growth specifically. It credits the divided Union more broadly for the country's growth in various dimensions.
Considering all this, B seems to be the best answer, as the passage explicitly anticipates the Union expanding into new territories under the existing Constitutional framework. C is also somewhat plausible, but B has more direct textual support.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",B,C,0,1403,380,1783,

Choices:

","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Akira comes to see Chie unannounced on a winter's night to ask for Naomi's hand in marriage. This breaks tradition, as he notes himself when he says ""Normally I would approach you more properly"".
2. Akira is aware that his direct approach is not proper. He says ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal."" This shows he is concerned Chie will view his proposal as inappropriate.
3. When Chie first sees Akira, she views him as a child and his earnest speech amuses her, almost in a maternal way. The passage states ""Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement."" 
4. However, there's no direct evidence that Akira fears Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. His own words and manner are quite serious and formal.
5. While Akira apologizes for the disruption, saying ""Madame, forgive my disruption"", Chie actually invites him in: ""Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two."" So he likely doesn't fear she'll consider his visit an imposition.
6. The passage doesn't provide any direct evidence about Akira fearing Chie will underestimate his sincerity. 
Considering the evidence, the reaction Akira most fears is that Chie will consider his untraditional, direct proposal to be inappropriate. This aligns with his own acknowledgment of the ""unseemliness"" of his approach.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",A,A,1,1690,383,2073,

","Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, focusing on how the narrator is portrayed throughout the passage:
The narrator notices many details about her surroundings in the shop - the dim lighting, the clean polished floors, the unbroken glass cases, how the ink boxes look nicer in the shop than at the village. This shows she is very observant and attuned to her environment.
She tries ""to notice everything"" so she can tell Gao-Ling about it later and make her envious. Again this highlights her attention to detail in order to relate her experience.
The narrator proudly listens to her Father eloquently describe the family's ink to a customer. She appreciates the artistry and meaning behind ink-making that her Aunt taught her. This further demonstrates the narrator's awareness and appreciation of her immediate surroundings and experiences.
While the narrator seems shy when first greeting her uncles, overall the passage emphasizes much more her keen observations about the shop, the ink, her father's sales pitch, and her aunt's ink-making philosophy. Her reserved nature is not a continuous portrayal.
Therefore, the best answer is that throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",B,A,0,1413,273,1686,

","Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The first paragraph sets up the scene of Akira arriving at Chie's house unexpectedly on a winter's night. It then poses the question of whether Chie would have been more receptive to his visit if he had followed tradition by having his mother speak to his father to approach a go-between first.
This paragraph seems to be questioning or criticizing the way Akira approached Chie directly, breaking tradition. The author is analyzing whether following tradition would have led to a different reaction from Chie.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: The paragraph mentions tradition, but describing culture does not seem to be the main purpose.
B: This could be it - the paragraph does seem to be criticizing Akira for breaking tradition and questioning if following tradition would have been better.
C: The paragraph is questioning Akira's approach, but not really a suggestion. 
D: Chie's reaction is not analyzed much in this paragraph.
After re-reading carefully, I believe the main purpose of this first paragraph is to criticize Akira's untraditional approach and question whether following tradition would have worked better. Therefore, the best answer is B.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",B,D,0,1605,277,1882,
