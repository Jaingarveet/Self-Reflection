The passage highlights the limitations of the second version of multicultural education, which prioritizes the use of Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures. The critics argue that this approach is problematic because it imposes the values of Western science on non-Western cultures, which can lead to a distorted understanding of these cultures.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered question E, ""Marshall's colleagues at the NAACP subsequently revised his methods and extended their applications to areas of law and politics beyond those for which they were designed,"" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage provides more support for answer C, ""Marshall's tactics were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP who favored a more traditional approach.""

The passage states that Marshall and the NAACP developed innovations that changed the landscape of public interest law, and that these innovations were initially opposed by some other members of the NAACP who favored a more traditional approach (C). This suggests that Marshall's tactics were not universally accepted within the NAACP, and that there was resistance to his more strategic and methodological approach.

In contrast, the passage does not provide as much support for answer A, ""The ideological motivations for Marshall's work with the NAACP changed during his tenure on the U.S. Supreme Court."" While it is true that Marshall's goals and successes have influenced a wide range of political objectives, the passage does not suggest that his ideological motivations shifted over time.

Similarly, answer B, ""Marshall declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable,"" is also not supported by the passage. While Marshall may have been selective in the cases he pursued, the passage does not suggest that he declined to pursue cases based on their potential impact on the public.

Finally, answer D, ""Marshall relied more on expert testimony in lower courts, whose judges were more likely than higher court judges to give weight to statistical evidence,"" is also not supported by the passage. While expert testimony may have played a role in Marshall's work, the passage does not suggest that he relied more on expert testimony in lower courts than in higher courts.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (A): helped spread the genes responsible for those same behaviors.

The passage explains that altruistic mechanisms, such as identification and empathy, likely arose in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. These mechanisms would have increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A): helped spread the genes responsible for those same behaviors.

Initial Answer:
I initially answered (D) influence particular brain functions. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the author is discussing the specific types of receptors found on neurons, rather than the functions of those neurons.

Correct Answer:
The author most likely uses the phrase ""defined categories of neurons"" in lines 55â€“56 to refer to (C) contain receptor molecules. The passage explains that each of the receptors in the family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels comes in several varieties, and that these varieties are found on different types of neurons. Therefore, the author is referring to the specific types of neurons that contain these receptors.

Explanation:
The passage states that ""receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions"" (lines 55â€“56). This suggests that the receptors are specific to certain types of neurons, and that the binding of a neurotransmitter to the receptor can influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. The author is therefore referring to the specific types of neurons that contain these receptors, rather than the functions of those neurons.

","  Reflection:
After re-reading the passages and analyzing the arguments presented, I realize that the correct answer is (E) Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable.

The passages highlight the lack of objective standards in fingerprint identification, which makes it difficult to determine the reliability of the evidence. In Passage A, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him, citing the inability of the fingerprint examiner to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The examiner testifies that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of ""points of identification"" required for a positive identification. This lack of standardization raises questions about the reliability of fingerprint identification.

In Passage B, the author argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match."" The author notes that different examiners use different methods for evaluating fingerprints, and there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed for a match. The author also highlights the lack of systematic study on the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice, making it difficult to determine the reliability of the evidence.

Therefore, the principle that underlies the arguments in both passages is the importance of objective standards in fingerprint identification. Fingerprint examiners must follow consistent and objective standards to ensure the reliability of their identifications. Without these standards, the reliability of fingerprint identification cannot be guaranteed.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered the question incorrectly, choosing option A: Some of them are the results of recent natural mutations in plants. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage suggests that secondary substances in plants are more likely to be the result of genetic mutations that occurred millions of years ago, rather than recent mutations.

The passage states that secondary substances first appeared in plants as the result of genetic mutations, and that these substances have been conserved by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms or because they are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, such as insects. This suggests that secondary substances have been present in plants for a long time, rather than being recent developments.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Some of them undergo chemical reactions with substances produced by insects, thus altering the plants' chemical composition. This option aligns with the passage's description of how secondary substances have evolved over time and how they interact with insects.

The passage explains that the traditional theory of electrical signaling in the brain is no longer tenable, as evidence suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. The passage also highlights the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, which are receptors that contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions. These receptors are found in various forms throughout the brain, and their subtle differences may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers is best described as (B) certain that it prevents defense lawyers from representing clients whom they know to be guilty.

The author emphasizes that defense lawyers have an obligation to the court and society, which is separate from their obligation to the defendant. They cannot present false or insincere arguments to the court, even if it means that the defendant may be found guilty. The author believes that defense lawyers should not take every case they are offered, but rather should only accept those cases where they are convinced of the defendant's innocence.

Therefore, option (B) best describes the author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers.

I previously answered question D, which states ""In his work with the NAACP during the 1940s and 1950s, Marshall adopted a set of tactics that were previously considered a radical departure from accepted practice, but which he adapted in such a way that they eventually became accepted conventions in the field of law."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B: ""The litigation strategies that Marshall devised in pursuit of the NAACP's civil rights goals during the 1940s and 1950s constituted significant innovations that have since been adopted as standard tactics for public interest lawyers.""

The passage highlights Marshall's development of strategic and methodological innovations in public interest law, which have been widely adopted by subsequent generations of lawyers. The author notes that Marshall's work with the NAACP, while initially considered radical, eventually became accepted conventions in the field of law. This is consistent with answer B, which states that Marshall's litigation strategies have become standard tactics for public interest lawyers.

I previously answered the question as follows:

""I believe the correct answer is (B) the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938. The passage states that Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. This suggests that Meitner conducted her own experiments in addition to the work of the Italian physicists. Therefore, the answer must be (B) the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not explicitly state that Meitner conducted her own experiments in addition to the work of the Italian physicists.

The sentence explains that traditional publishers are reluctant to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors due to their heavy investment in the infrastructure of traditional publishing. This context helps to understand why traditional publishers are initially reluctant to embrace digital publishing and why upstart digital-publishing firms may have an advantage in bidding for new manuscripts.

The passage provides detailed information about the origins and characteristics of the corrido, including its use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, its heavy reliance on metaphors, and its use of standard generic elements. The passage also highlights the importance of the corrido in affirming the cohesiveness of Border communities and its continued relevance in contemporary times.

The passage explains that in the 1930s, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. However, these calculations were not taken seriously by the physics community at the time, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in the context of neutron bombardment of uranium. This is evident from the statement that ""a common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.""

E: The only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that the city is facing a problem of overdue water bills, with 231,000 customers late paying their bills, owing the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. The city officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. However, the passage also mentions that there is a loophole in the law that prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city.

The passage does not provide any information to suggest that most water customers in the city are late paying their water bills, or that most of the residences with outstanding water bills are in the city's high-income neighborhoods. The passage also does not provide any information to suggest that it is appropriate to turn off the water of high-income residents in the city who pay their water bills a few days late.

Therefore, the only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city, as inferred from the material in passage B, is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes. This would allow the city to attach liens to the property of delinquent water customers, ensuring that the money owed becomes available whenever a property is sold, and providing a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations.",,,D,0,1216,404,1620,

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option C: accumulation of financial assets in investments. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option E: generally acknowledged social status in a community.

The passage highlights the democratizing effect of technological advancements, which refers to the process of making new technology accessible to a wider range of people. This is evident in the examples provided, such as the widespread availability of printed materials, personal computers, and electronic mail. These technologies have made it possible for people to access information and communicate with others in ways that were previously reserved for a select few.

Option E, generally acknowledged social status in a community, is the best fit for this concept. The passage does not suggest that the democratizing effect of technology is related to the distribution of tangible and intangible goods (option A), the opportunity to create new technology (option B), or the participation in the regulation of society through either public or private institutions (option D).

Therefore, the correct answer is option E: generally acknowledged social status in a community.",,,A,0,1029,244,1273,

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The correct answer is C, ""In Jazz, Morrison develops her narrative in such a way that the voices of individual characters are sometimes difficult to distinguish, in much the same way that individual musicians' voices merge in ensemble jazz playing.""

The passage explains that Morrison's novel uses narrative techniques inspired by jazz, such as shifting between first-person and third-person narrators, to create a sense of ensemble and individuality. The author argues that Morrison's use of these techniques allows her to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view, just as Duke Ellington's compositional style allowed him to redefine the possibilities of jazz composition.

In contrast, choices A and C do not accurately capture the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work. Choice A, enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects, suggests that the author is only interested in Lichtenstein's more provocative or subversive works, rather than the artist's broader themes and techniques.

After re-reading the passage and the question, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. I selected option C, ""apprehension about the possibility of its misuse,"" but upon further reflection, I realize that the author's attitude is more accurately described as option B, ""optimism about its potential applications.""

The passage highlights the discovery of the structure of receptors that mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, and how this discovery raises the possibility of selectively treating certain brain disorders. The author notes that pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance certain effects. This suggests that the author is optimistic about the potential applications of this discovery, rather than apprehensive about its misuse.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""optimism about its potential applications.""",,,B,0,1128,206,1334,

Initial Answer: D) necessary

Reasoning: The passage suggests that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was a deliberate and intentional approach to litigation, designed to achieve specific goals and address systemic injustices. The author notes that Marshall ""carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed"" (para. 5), and that he used sociological and psychological statistics to persuade courts of the constitutional violations of discriminatory laws (para. 6). This suggests that Marshall's approach was not arbitrary or inflexible, but rather a deliberate and strategic effort to advance the NAACP's goals.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) unprecedented. The passage highlights the innovative nature of Marshall's approach, noting that the NAACP's campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation involved ""a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated"" (para. 4). This approach was new and groundbreaking at the time, and it has since become the norm for U.S. public interest litigation.

The use of metaphors and ready-made lines in corridos are also consistent with the idea that the form is unique in its use of local language and themes.

I previously answered the question as follows:

""The author refers to 'self, life, and writing' most probably in order to define a word that had a different meaning for early Native Americans than it has for contemporary Native Americans.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not provide any evidence to suggest that the meaning of ""self,"" ""life,"" or ""writing"" was different for early Native Americans than it is for contemporary Native Americans. In fact, the passage highlights the cultural constructs of highly diverse Native American peoples, indicating that their understanding of these concepts was shaped by their unique cultural perspectives.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

""The author refers to 'self, life, and writing' most probably in order to illustrate how words can undergo a change in meaning after their introduction into the language.""

Explanation:
The passage suggests that the concept of autobiography was shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted it. This means that the meaning of ""self,"" ""life,"" and ""writing"" may have evolved over time as these concepts were adapted to different cultural contexts. The author is likely highlighting the idea that the meanings of these words were not fixed or universal, but rather were shaped by the specific cultural and historical contexts in which they were used.

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The passage suggests that the evolutionary competition between plants and insects has led to the development of secondary substances in plants, which are defensive chemicals that deter insects from feeding on them. The passage also states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses, such as detoxifying harmful substances or avoiding their effects.

Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement (D): ""While many species of insects have evolved ways of circumventing plants' chemical defenses, none has done this through outright immunity to plants' secondary substances.""

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice (B) put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not align with the passage's description of Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view.

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' demand for reality to be depicted as it is is meaningless, as reality is necessarily shaped by the person experiencing it. This means that there is no clear distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work, as what may be reality for one person may not be reality for another. Therefore, choice (A) draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work, is not the best answer.

The passage also highlights Dostoyevsky's belief that artistic merit is crucial in evaluating literary works, as it is the ability to express thoughts in characters and images that allows the reader to fully understand the author's thoughts. This suggests that choice (D) recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, is the best answer.

The passage explains that proponents of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding have different views on how to approach the study of non-Western cultures. One proposal holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, using the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. However, critics argue that this approach is problematic because it is based on Western methods and values, and therefore cannot provide a genuine understanding of non-Western cultures.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C): proved that the nuclei of atoms were generally unstable.

Here's why:

The passage explains that the neutron bombardment experiments conducted between 1934 and 1938 produced puzzling radioactive substances that were unidentified due to the minute quantities produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. Meitner's insight was that these substances were actually evidence of nuclear fission, which she recognized as a result of her understanding of the underlying theoretical considerations.

The passage does not suggest that the theoretical physicists in line 16 were pleased about Meitner's insight because it was dependent upon their calculations (A), paved the way for work in theoretical physics to become more acceptable abroad (B), or continued their earlier work indicating that atoms could be split (D). While Meitner's insight did build upon the earlier work of the theoretical physicists, the passage emphasizes that her insight was based on her understanding of the underlying theoretical considerations, which were not dependent on the calculations of the theoretical physicists.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice (C) as the correct answer, stating that Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements obscures the emotional complexity contained in his paintings, preventing his work from being recognized as fine art in the expressionist tradition. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

The passage suggests that Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements is not solely a parodic reaction to the high-mindedness of later abstract expressionism but also demonstrates an attempt to achieve realistic and nostalgic effects simultaneously in his paintings. This is evident in the passage's description of Lichtenstein's work as ""full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color,"" which suggests a deliberate naivete and a desire to depict contemporary life in a realistic manner.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (B): Lichtenstein's use of comic book elements is not solely a parodic reaction to the high-mindedness of later abstract expressionism but also demonstrates an attempt to achieve realistic and nostalgic effects simultaneously in his paintings.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Over time, it moved from intensity to lyricism.

Self-Reflection:

I realized that I misunderstood the passage's description of the evolution of abstract expressionism. I mistakenly thought that the passage was describing a shift from abstraction to realism, when in fact it was describing a loss of force and intensity in the movement. I also underestimated the importance of the passage's mention of the second generation of abstract expressionists, who were seen as airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. This led me to incorrectly infer that abstract expressionism moved from intensity to lyricism.

After reviewing the passage and the question, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect.

However, upon further analysis, I understand that this option is not the most closely analogous to the strategies used by Marshall during his work with the NAACP.

The correct answer is option (C) preference for pursuing a series of cases that are to be tried in courts having a record of decisions that are favorable to environmental interests; and taking these cases to judges who strictly uphold constitutional principles. This option aligns with Marshall's approach of carefully selecting cases with sympathetic litigants and strategically choosing the right plaintiff to maximize the chances of success.

In the context of environmental advocacy public interest law firms, option (C) reflects the strategic approach of selecting cases that are likely to be heard and decided in favor of environmental interests, and presenting them to judges who are known to be sympathetic to these causes. This approach is similar to Marshall's focus on selecting the right cases and plaintiffs to advance the NAACP's goals.

Initial Answer: B - ability to help bring about social change

Reasoning: The passage suggests that the radical critics' demand for art to be useful means contributing to the creation of a new society. Dostoyevsky disagrees with this view, arguing that it is impossible to know what will be useful in the future.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is C - ability to help bring about social change. The passage highlights Dostoyevsky's belief that art should not be limited by the demands of utility, but rather should strive to explore the boundaries of the tangible world. Dostoyevsky sees art as a means of challenging the status quo and bringing about social change, rather than simply serving a particular political view.

The passage explains that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.

Choice B highlights the structural similarities between the novel and jazz music, but it does not reveal the author's overall appreciation for the novel. Choice C describes the narration's ability to slip between different voices and perspectives, but it does not indicate the author's opinion on the novel's musical influences. Choice D suggests that the novel creates a sense of improvisation within a fixed scope, but it does not convey the author's admiration for the novel's musical connections.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, which accurately reflects the author's attitude toward Jazz as a novel that celebrates the cultural significance of music in the African American tradition.",,,A,0,1224,370,1594,

","  Reflection:

After re-reading the passage and the question, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect. The author of passage A is actually more likely to agree with statement C: The plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.

The passage explains that the water department has a history of enforcing rules overinclusively, which can lead to heavy social costs. The plan described in lines 41-47 in passage B is to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that the water department is serious about collecting debts. The author of passage A acknowledges that this plan may reduce the social costs associated with overinclusive rule enforcement, as it targets only high-income neighborhoods and a few privileged residents.

Therefore, the author of passage A would likely agree that the plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.

","  Reflection:

I previously answered choice (B) as the correct objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not the strongest objection.

The correct answer is choice (E): Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This objection is the strongest because it highlights the importance of adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied in order to truly understand it. The other choices do not address this point as directly.

For example, choice (A) is incorrect because it suggests that one cannot adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless they are a member of that culture. While this may be true to some extent, it is not a sufficient condition for understanding a culture.

Choice (C) is also incorrect because it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. While this may be the case in some instances, it is not a universal practice and does not address the broader issue of understanding cultures from a non-Western perspective.

Finally, choice (D) is incorrect because it suggests that students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations. While it is true that Western scientific methods have a privileged place in Western cultures, this does not mean that other cultures cannot or should not be studied using their own perspectives and methods.

In conclusion, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This requires adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied, rather than relying solely on Western scientific methods.",,,A,0,1158,402,1560,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A: The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the scenario described in the passage.

The passage suggests that the digital publishing model will eliminate the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This means that the need for warehousing will not shift to paper and binding material, as there will be no physical books to store.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers. As the digital publishing model eliminates the need for physical books, there will be less demand for editors and designers who work on physical books.

After re-reading the passage, I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The passage actually suggests that the author would agree with statement C: The rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

Here's my reasoning:

The passage explains that the author's economic principle of utility maximization can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime. According to this principle, an individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. If the expected utility of lawful activities increases, the author suggests that the rate of deliberate crimes will decrease. This is because the individual will be less likely to choose to commit a crime if the expected utility of lawful activities is higher.

Therefore, the author would agree with statement C, which suggests that the rate of deliberate crimes will decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.

This means that the concept of identity was not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and interconnected.

Therefore, the most consistent answer is choice (C) - a similar ritual for assuming a new name is used in diverse communities.
