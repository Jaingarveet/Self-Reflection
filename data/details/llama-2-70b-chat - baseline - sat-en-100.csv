  D: Douglas offers an interpretation of federal law that conflicts with Lincoln's, and Lincoln implies that Douglas's interpretation is poorly reasoned. 40
","  The central tension between the two passages is that Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.

In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that the Constitution, which allows for the division of states into free and slave states, is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. Douglas, in Passage 2, responds to Lincoln's argument by suggesting that Lincoln is misinterpreting the Constitution and that the division of states into free and slave states is not a violation of the law of God. Douglas also implies that Lincoln's position is hypocritical, as he accepted his nomination for the Senatorship under the same Constitution that he now claims is flawed.

Therefore, Choice C, ""Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position,"" accurately identifies the central tension between the two passages.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

The question that Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer is: ""Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?"" Maguire and her team wanted to find out if the brains of mental athletes were structurally different from those of the control subjects, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. They found that the brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects, but that they were engaging different circuitry when memorizing information. Specifically, they were using regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, such as the right posterior hippocampal region, which was also enlarged in London cabbies who had spent years navigating the city's streets. This suggests that the mental athletes' heightened memorization ability is the result of an unusual use of normal brain structure, rather than abnormal brain structure.

","  Answer: C

The main purpose of the passage is to explain research conducted to study why some birds fly in a V formation, as stated in the question. The passage describes a study that used data loggers to track the flight patterns of northern bald ibises and found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The study suggests that birds fly in a V formation to save energy during flight, and the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because while the passage mentions that squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a V formation, this is not the main purpose of the passage.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage discusses the effects of downdrafts on birds and airplanes, this is not the main focus of the passage.

Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the fourth paragraph does discuss the role of downdrafts in V-formation flight, this discussion is brief and does not constitute a main purpose.

","  Answer: C

In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have a subordinate relationship to men in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. He states that women are designed to gain influence and exercise power differently than men, specifically through ""the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles"" and by making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved. Therefore, option C, ""Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities,"" is the best answer.","Choice B is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beecher makes the point that even if women in her society are perceived as being inferior to men, they are still able to effect considerable influence on that society: ""But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Beecher describes the dynamic between men and women in terms of the way they can change society, not in terms of security and physical safety.

The passage states that Volkov and his colleagues ""rigged up very fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap"" and that they ""modified this experiment by altering the amount of electrical current"" to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close. This suggests that they used empirical data obtained from their own experiments to study the Venus flytrap's response to electrical current. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention the use of mathematical models to predict the electrical charge required to close the Venus flytrap.

Option B is also incorrect because while the passage mentions previous researchers' work involving the Venus flytrap's response to electricity, it does not suggest that Volkov and his colleagues relied heavily on this data in their research.

Explanation:

The overall sequence of events in the passage is as follows:

1. Ken Dial observes a pattern in how young ground birds run along behind their parents and decides to conduct a study to investigate the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate.
2. Ken settles on the Chukar Partridge as a model species and designs a project to measure the birds' first hops and flights.
3. The local rancher advises Ken to give the birds something to climb on, as they prefer to rest on ledges or low branches rather than the ground.
4. Ken brings in hay bales for the Chukars to perch on, and his son Terry feeds and collects data on the birds.
5. Terry observes the baby Chukars using their legs to run up the side of the hay bales, flapping their wings all the while.
6. Ken dashes out to see for himself and realizes that the birds are using their wings and legs cooperatively.
7. Ken and Terry come up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
8. The birds are found to be using a technique called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running), which allows them to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and gives adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
9. The Dials document WAIR in a wide range of species and propose a new hypothesis to explain the origin of the flapping flight stroke of birds.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.","Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing how baby Chukars learn to fly. During the experiment, Dial noticed the unusual way Chukars use their ""'wings and legs cooperatively'"" to scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created ""a series of ingenious experiments"" (line 46) to study this observation.

The fact that Miss Spivey avoids Ralphord's eye when asking questions and doesn't seem to give him the attention he wants suggests that she is not particularly interested in engaging with him or his questions. At the same time, Ralphord's question about what Miss Spivey studied at ""Barnyard College"" and his request for clarification when she mentions John Dewey's book suggest that he is a curious and intelligent student who is eager to learn. Overall, this interaction sets up a dynamic between Miss Spivey and Ralphord that is different from the rest of the students in the class.","Choice A is the best answer.

Context: The chemical formula of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is now well established. The molecule is a very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a regular alternation of sugar and phosphate groups. To each sugar is attached a nitrogenous base, which can be of four different types. Two of the possible bases - adenine and guanine - are purines, and the other two - thymine and cytosine - are pyrimidines. So far as is known, the sequence of bases along the chain is irregular. The monomer unit, consisting of phosphate, sugar, and base, is known as a nucleotide. The first feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists not of one chain but of two. These two chains are both coiled around a common fiber axis. It has often been assumed that since there was only one chain in the chemical formula, there would only be one in the structural unit. However, the density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that there are two. The other biologically important feature is the manner in which the two chains are held together. This is done by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The bases are joined together in pairs, a single base from one chain being hydrogen-bonded to a single base from the other. The important point is that only certain pairs of bases will fit into the structure. One member of a pair must be a purine and the other a pyrimidine in order to bridge between the two chains. If a pair consisted of two purines, for example, there would not be room for it. We believe that the bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms. If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: adenine with thymine and guanine with cytosine. Adenine, for example, can occur on either chain; but when it does, its partner on the other chain must always be thymine. The phosphate-sugar backbone of our model is completely regular, but any sequence of the pairs of bases can fit into the structure. It follows that in a long molecule, many different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems likely that the precise sequence of bases is the code that carries the genetical information. If the actual order of the bases on one of the pair of chains were given, one could write down the exact order of the bases on the other one, because of the specific pairing. Thus, one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is this feature that suggests how the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule might duplicate itself. The table shows, for various organisms, the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in that organism's DNA.

Question: Do the data in the table support the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DNA?
Choices:
  A: Yes, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine.
  B: Yes, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of guanine, and the percentage of cytosine is closest to the percentage of thymine.
  C: No, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine.
  D: No, because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of guanine, and the percentage of cytosine is closest to the percentage of thymine.

Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation: The table shows the percentage of each type of nitrogenous base in DNA for various organisms. The authors propose that the bases pair in a specific manner, with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine. The data in the table support this proposal, as for each organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine. This suggests that the bases are paired in the manner proposed by the authors. Therefore, the correct answer is choice A.

The narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Throughout the passage, the narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing details such as the polished wooden floors, the shiny glass cases, and the different qualities of inksticks. She is also described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in creating art. These details suggest that the narrator is someone who is attuned to her surroundings and values attention to detail.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people (choice A). While she is initially hesitant to approach her uncle, she quickly warms up to him and engages in conversation.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave.""

  C: A large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","  Answer: B

According to Hodick and Sievers' model, the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.

In choice B, the large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably. This means that the calcium ion concentration in the trap has decreased over time, and it may not be high enough to close the trap even if a second hair is touched. Therefore, the Venus flytrap will not close around the insect in this scenario.

The other choices do not describe scenarios in which the Venus flytrap will not close around an insect. In choice A, the large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold, which means the trap will close. In choice C, the large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap, which is a necessary step for the trap to close. In choice D, the large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair, which is within the time frame required for the trap to close.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",,B,0,1384,337,1721,

The passage highlights the transformative effect of Eppie's presence on Silas' life, emphasizing how her innocence, joy, and curiosity reawaken his senses, stir his heart, and gradually bring him out of his lonely, stifling existence. The narrative underscores the redemptive power of parental love and the ways in which it can revive a person's spirit, awaken dormant emotions, and create new connections. Therefore, option D, ""The restorative power of parental love,"" best captures a major theme of the passage.","Choice $D$ is the best answer.

The passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.

  B: deceptive, since economic domination would be the true goal of the American government.
  C: impractical, since the islanders would insist upon an equal distribution of resources.
  D: naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.
Answer: D

Explanation: Bryan's criticism of American imperialism in Passage 2 suggests that he would disagree with Beveridge's vision of expanding American governance to island territories. Bryan believes that the principles of self-government and liberty that the US was founded upon would be compromised by such a policy. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it states that the islanders would object to being governed by Americans, which aligns with Bryan's argument.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines. However, in the first paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan warns, ""If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ... must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",,D,0,1389,372,1761,

Therefore, the conclusion that is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because according to the passage, Olausson's 1993 study didn't compare how signal speed was affected by stimulation in different bodily areas (choice (A)or by different amounts of pressure applied to the nerve (choice D).

","  Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling ""Dad-dad's"" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that ""Dad-dad"" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

The passage states that the baby Chukars used their wings to help them scramble up steep ramps by aiming their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp.

The passage discusses findings that offer a scientific explanation for the Venus flytrap's closing action.

The passage also mentions research that supports the model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at the University of Bonn in Germany, which suggests that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Therefore, choice A is the best answer.","Choice A is the best answer. The first two paragraphs of the passage describe the physical process by which the Venus flytrap closes its trap but also note certain long-standing questions about that process: ""How does the plant encode and store the information from the unassuming bug's encounter with the first hair? How does it remember the first touch in order to react upon the second?""

The passage describes the protagonist's visit to her family's ink shop, where she observes her father and uncles at work and listens to their conversations with customers. The visit deepens her appreciation of her family's work and helps her understand her father's ambitions. While the passage does include some fond memories of the protagonist's aunt, it does not focus primarily on her aunt or their relationship. Similarly, while there is a happy reunion between the protagonist and her family members, the passage does not emphasize this aspect of the visit. Overall, choice D best summarizes the passage.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer.

The passage highlights the importance of quality and deliberate effort in the production of inksticks. The author's father and uncles are described as taking great care in the creation of their inksticks, and the author is proud to hear her father speak of their family's ink in a way that emphasizes its high quality. The passage also mentions Precious Auntie's teachings that good ink cannot be quick or easy to produce, and that the process of pushing an inkstick along an inkstone is a way of cleansing one's mind and heart. These elements suggest that a main theme of the passage is the importance of deliberate effort and quality in creative endeavors. Therefore, option B is the best answer.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator recounts her Precious Auntie's belief that ""you can never be an artist if your work comes without effort."" Her Precious Auntie states that when the physical act of writing is done with an ""inkstick along an inkstone,"" this process requires an artist to ""take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?"" In the following paragraphs, the narrator recalls the pride she felt while listening to her father describe the high quality of the ink that her family had worked hard to produce. Therefore, a main theme of the passage is that quality is achieved through deliberate effort. Choice A is incorrect. Although family relationships form a backdrop to the passage, the nurturing of these relationships isn't a main theme. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. Although the passage does emphasize that hard work produces higher quality writing than that which is produced through minimal work, the passage doesn't mention that hard work results in material compensation.

The table shows the percentage of each type of nitrogenous base in various organisms' DNA. The passage states that the percentages of adenine and guanine in yeast DNA are 18.7% and 17.1%, respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C: $18.7 \%$ and $17.1 \%$.

Choice A is incorrect because it reverses the percentages of adenine and guanine in yeast DNA.

Choice B is incorrect because it gives the percentage of cytosine (17.1%) and thymine (32.9%) in yeast DNA, which are not the purines.

Choice D is incorrect because it gives the total percentage of purines (31.3% + 32.9% = 64.2%) in yeast DNA, which is not a specific percentage of adenine and guanine.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

","Choices:
  A: has renounced all desire for money.
  B: better understands his place in nature.
  C: seems more accepting of help from others.
  D: looks forward to a different kind of future
","  Answer: D

The passage suggests that Silas' adoption of Eppie has led him to look forward to a different kind of future. Before Eppie came into his life, Silas was described as being trapped in a ""cold, narrow prison"" of his own thoughts and obsessed with his gold. In contrast, Eppie represents new life, hope, and change, and her presence has awakened Silas to the world around him. Now, he looks forward to the future with anticipation, eager to see what Eppie will learn and do next. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator indicates that with the arrival of Eppie, Silas's thoughts turn from his work and his gold toward Eppie's future and his life with her: ""Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit - carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years."" By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage explains that Silas spends time outdoors after the arrival of Eppie, there is no indication that her presence has necessarily changed his understanding of his place in nature.

","  Answer: D

Explanation:
Passage 1 presents a view on the role of women in society, arguing that women should conform to a subordinate position and exert influence through peaceful and benevolent means. Passage 2, written by Grimké, responds to Beecher's argument by emphasizing the equal rights and responsibilities of women and men as moral beings. Grimké's argument builds upon and expands the ideas presented in Passage 1, specifically addressing the issue of women's rights and their relationship to morality. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not ""exert coercive influences"" that would put her ""out of her appropriate sphere"" (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 . Choice $C$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society.

  C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.
  D: Political activism is as important for women as it is for men.
","  Based on the passages, both authors would agree with claim C: The ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.

In Passage 1, Grimké argues that women have a subordinate role in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence should be any less important or pervasive. He emphasizes that women should win respect and influence through peaceful and benevolent means, such as cultivating their intellect, being benevolent in feeling and action, and being unassuming and unambitious. He also suggests that women should seek cooperation and combination among their own sex to assist them in their appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal, and domestic duty.

In Passage 2, Grimké further argues that the investigation of the rights of the slave has led her to a better understanding of her own rights. She asserts that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature. She also argues that the mere circumstance of sex does not give man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman.

Both passages suggest that women have important moral duties and responsibilities, and that their ethical obligations are often undervalued. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

The author also suggests that women are not suited for strenuous habits and onerous duties and are instead summoned to gentle occupations and the cares of the home.

In Passage 2, the author argues that women need education to become the companion of man and to understand their duty and the true principle of patriotism.

Explanation: In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect because women exert their influence within the home and family life. Beecher argues that women are designed to have a subordinate relation in society to men, but this does not mean that their duties or influence should be any less important. Instead, women are to win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved, and thus exerting their influence in the domestic and social circle. Therefore, option B is the best answer.","Choice B is the best answer. In the third paragraph (lines 22-37), Beecher suggests that women can be ""so much respected, esteemed and loved"" by those around them that men will accede to their wishes: ""then, the fathers, the husbands, and the sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly ...."" These lines show that Beecher believes women can influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect influence on public life. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because lines 34-37 make it clear that Beecher believes women do have an effect on society, even if it is an indirect effect. Beecher does not indicate that women's effect on public life is ignored because most men are not interested (choice $A$ ), unnecessary because men do not need help governing society (choice C), or merely symbolic because women tend to be idealistic (choice D).",,B,0,1455,127,1582,

The narrator notes that Eppie's presence ""stirred Silas' heart"" and ""unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness."" This suggests that Eppie's expanding awareness and engagement with the world are connected to Silas's increasing engagement with life, making choice B the best answer.","Choice B is the best answer. The third paragraph of the passage shows that as Eppie learns more and more, Silas reengages with life: ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness."" As Eppie grows into a world that is new to her, Silas recovers a world he'd largely forgotten. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the narrator portrays Eppie as being curious and eager, not physically vulnerable, and also implies that Silas is becoming ever more emotionally robust, not psychologically fragile. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the only connection the narrator makes regarding Silas's former greed and Eppie's presence in his life is that she has brought an end to his obsessive pursuit of wealth.

The passage states that Sempere is a bookseller who allows the protagonist to read books in his shop and sometimes gives him books for free.

However, there is no indication that Sempere models his own writing after Dickens's style (choice A), feels a personal connection to details of Dickens's biography (choice C), or considers himself to be Dickens's most appreciative reader (choice D).

Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:
In Passage 1, Tocqueville argues that men and women have different natural abilities and should have different roles in society. He believes that women should be subordinate to men and that their main role is to provide moral and emotional support to men. On the other hand, Mill argues in Passage 2 that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests and develop their own abilities without being limited by their sex or class. He believes that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest that they are able to attain to, and that employments should be open to all without favor or discouragement to any. Therefore, choice A is the best answer, as it accurately describes the difference in how Tocqueville and Mill conceive of the individual's proper position in society.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1459,412,1871,

","  Action: Answer(""D"")

The second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger.

According to the passage, the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close because the second trigger provides a necessary supplement to the calcium concentration released by the first trigger. The first trigger hair being touched does not reach the threshold level of calcium needed to close the trap, so a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant. The fourth paragraph further explains that the calcium concentration produced by this initial touch isn't enough to cause the trap to close, but that a second hair touch will bring the total concentration to the level necessary to close the trap: ""a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.""Choices A and B are incorrect because the fourth paragraph explains that the second trigger supplements the action of the first trigger, not that it reverses it (choice (A)or stabilizes its effect (choice B).

Explanation:
The passage begins by discussing the narrator's love of reading and how it served as a refuge from their troubled home life. It then shifts to a specific incident where the narrator's father discovers their reading habit and tears a book from their hands, throwing it out the window. Following this, the narrator describes their favorite bookshop and how the bookseller there allows them to read books for free and even gifts them a volume of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations."" The passage culminates in the narrator expressing their desire to learn to write like Dickens.

Therefore, the main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading (option A) to a portrayal of an influential incident where the narrator receives a meaningful gift from the bookseller (option A).","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer.

","  The answer is A: They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.

In Passage 1, the author mentions that the resources extracted from space will be used to meet earthly demands for precious metals and rare earth elements. However, the passage also mentions that water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield, and that splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel. This implies that resources that are not necessarily valuable on Earth, such as water, may be highly valued in space.

In Passage 2, the author explicitly states that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. This reinforces the idea that resources that are not valuable on Earth may be highly valued in space.

It is mentioned that in normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated when CT fibers were activated, but only the insular cortex was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm. This suggests that G.L.'s somatosensory cortex was affected in some way, leading to a difference in its physical dimensions compared to the other test subjects. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, ""in normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated [by gentle brushing], but only the insular cortex [which processes emotion] was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm.""

In Passage 2, Bryan argues that the desire for self-government is a fundamental aspect of human nature. He states that God has placed the love of liberty in every human heart, and that no race of people is so low in civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master. This suggests that the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule is an innate drive in humans, rather than a reaction to imperial governments, a sign of belief in human equality, or a testament to the effects of US foreign policy. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice D is the best answer.

","  Answer: B

The table shows the percentage of colonies affected by each pathogen and by all four pathogens together, for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. The data provide support for the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honey bee's susceptibility to secondary infections because for each pathogen, the percentage of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.

The authors include information about X-ray evidence and density to support their claim that there are two chains in a molecule of DNA.

","  Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
The passage states that ""irritated or not, the majority of those present were inclined to see the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive light."" This suggests that most people at the train station are open-minded and welcoming towards Miss Spivey. However, the passage also states that ""when folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else."" This implies that some people might feel resentful or annoyed when Miss Spivey compares the heat in Georgia to the heat in Timbuktu, which they might perceive as belittling their experience. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice D is the best answer. In the first paragraph, Miss Spivey remarks that the heat in Georgia is nothing compared to the heat she experienced in Timbuktu. Later in this paragraph the narrator states, ""I believe her remark irritated some of the people gathered to welcome her on the burned grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating through their shorts, they don't like to hear that this is nothing compared to someplace else."" Hence it can reasonably be inferred from the passage that some of the people at the train station regard Miss Spivey's comment about the Georgia heat with resentment because they feel that she is minimizing their discomfort.Choice A is incorrect because Miss Spivey informs the people at the train station that she has experienced even more extreme heat, so they wouldn't have assumed that she is experiencing intense heat for the first time. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that the people at the station know Miss Spivey is coming to Threestep to work, not that they doubt she will stay there very long. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that the people at the train station imagine that she is superior to them.",D,D,1,1627,162,1789,

  C: Volkov's direct application of an electrical current would have been objectionable to Hodick and Sievers.
  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
","  Answer: B

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov tested Hodick and Sievers' model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap. However, the passage also states that Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers' model, as he applied an electrical current directly to the trap, rather than measuring the electric charge of the leaf. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers' model was incorrect.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.

Option D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate whether the technology Volkov used had been available to Hodick and Sievers when they formulated their model.",,B,0,1357,234,1591,

","Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","  Answer: 
The narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.

Throughout the passage, the narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing details such as the polished wooden floors, the shiny glass cases, and the different qualities of inksticks. She is also described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in creating art. These details suggest that the narrator is someone who is attuned to her surroundings and values attention to detail.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people (choice A). While she is initially hesitant to approach her uncle, she quickly warms up to him and engages in conversation.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen.""

According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before.

Answer: A
Explanation: Both Beveridge and Bryan express admiration for the founding and history of the United States in their speeches. Beveridge references the ""glorious history"" of the United States and its ""heaven-directed purposes,"" while Bryan quotes Patrick Henry's famous statement ""Give me liberty or give me death"" and references the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Neither speech focuses on the vibrancy and diversity of American culture (B), the worldwide history of struggles for independence (C), or the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society (D). Therefore, the correct answer is (A).","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture.

","  Answer: C

The passage implies that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in a V formation, as the author states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. However, the author does not mention anything about their communication methods, migration routes, or energy expenditure, so options A, B, and D are not implied by the passage.

In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication.

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Answer: C

The passage states that the Venus flytrap needs to conserve its energy supply, as closing its trap requires a significant amount of energy and reopening it can take several hours. The plant achieves this by requiring multiple triggers (the touch of two hairs) to spring the trap closed, which ensures that it only closes when a large enough insect is present, making it worth the energy expenditure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey.

Option B is incorrect because while calcium is involved in the mechanism of the Venus flytrap's closure, the passage does not suggest that the plant's calcium reserves are a concern.

Option D is incorrect because while the plant does need to wait for a second trigger before closing, this is not done to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey, but rather to ensure that it only closes when a large enough insect is present.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",,C,0,1314,226,1540,

  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.

  D: analyze a reaction.
","  Answer: A

The first paragraph describes a culture by presenting a situation in which a man, Akira, breaks tradition by approaching a woman, Chie, directly to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage, rather than following the custom of using a go-between. The paragraph highlights the cultural significance of this tradition and Chie's surprise at Akira's unconventional approach. Therefore, option A is the best answer.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","  Answer: B

In Passage 1, Beveridge presents liberty as a noble ideal that has been bestowed upon the United States by God and emphasizes the country's destiny to spread this liberty to other regions through imperial expansion. On the other hand, in Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principles of self-government and popular sovereignty, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, should not be repudiated in the Philippines or elsewhere. Bryan sees liberty as a fundamental right that all people possess and warns against the negative consequences of imperialism on both the colonized people and the United States itself.

Therefore, option B is the best choice, as it accurately describes the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty. Beveridge sees liberty as something that can be exported through conquest, while Bryan sees it as a fundamental right that should not be compromised through imperial expansion.","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",,B,0,1457,212,1669,
