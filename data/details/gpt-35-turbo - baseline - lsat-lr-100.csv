The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment conducted on 50 patients with chronic back pain.
To counter this argument logically, we need to provide evidence that weakens the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
Option A suggests that the improvement in the condition of patients could be due to the placebo effect.
Option B is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.
Option C is also irrelevant to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.

The argument acknowledges that people often encourage us to learn the lessons of history, but it questions the feasibility of doing so. The argument does not take a position on whether we should or should not learn the lessons of history.

","Thought:
The argument concludes that if a stray cocker spaniel is found near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. To evaluate the argument, we need to find out whether the conclusion is reasonable or not. 
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
Option C is somewhat relevant, but it does not help us to evaluate the argument.
Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
Option E is relevant because if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods, then the conclusion of the argument is more likely to be true.
