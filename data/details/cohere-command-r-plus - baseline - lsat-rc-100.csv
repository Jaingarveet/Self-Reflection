The author of Passage B characterizes evolutionary psychology as a ""conspiracy theory"" because it attributes an underlying interest (genetic proliferation) to individuals that they do not consciously acknowledge or recognize. This interest, according to the theory, drives their behavior without their explicit awareness.

In Passage A, the assertion that ""genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish"" (Choice D) directly reflects this idea. It suggests that individuals' behaviors, which appear altruistic and unselfish on the surface, are ultimately driven by the hidden agenda of their genes to propagate themselves. This interpretation aligns with the concept of a ""conspiracy theory"" as described in Passage B.

This means that while they must provide the best possible defense for their clients, they should not present assertions that they know to be false, especially if they know their client is guilty. In such cases, the lawyer should present the case in as favorable a light as possible and argue for leniency if warranted.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the author is confident that the twofold obligation enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities.

  E: Morrison disguises the important struetural connections between her narrative and Duke Ellington's jazz compositions by making the transitions between first- and third-person narrators appear easy.
","Choices:
  A: In Jazz, Mortison has perfected a style of narration that had been attempted with little success by other North American writers in the twentieth century.
  B: Because ofits use of narrative techniques inspired by jazz, Mortison's novel represents the most successful representation to date of the milieu in which jazz musicians live and work.
  C: In Jazz, Mortison develops her narrative in such a way that the voices of individual characters are sometimes difficult to distinguish, in much the same way that individual musicians' voices merge in ensemble jazz playing.

  E: Morrison disguises the important struetural connections between her narrative and Duke Ellington's jazz compositions by making the transitions between first- and third-person narrators appear easy.
","Thought: 
The correct answer is D. The author of the passage states that the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style involves more than just the use of shifting narrative perspectives. This is supported by the description of how the novel's narration mirrors the structure of a jazz band, with its blend of ensemble and solo performances, and the way Morrison allows characters' voices to exist within the framework of the overall narrative, akin to Ellington's compositions.

Increasing returns to scale refers to the concept where larger-scale production or operations lead to greater efficiency and/or output, often due to specialization. 

Choice B describes a bee colony that, due to its large size, can divide up work efficiently. By having some bees dedicated to guarding nectar sources, the colony can collect more nectar and sustain a larger population, which further increases efficiency through specialized tasks. This example illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale, as the larger colony benefits from greater efficiency and output.

The passage outlines a debate about the ethical obligations of defense lawyers, specifically whether they must believe their clients are innocent to provide an effective defense. The author presents a balanced argument, acknowledging the scholars' view that lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense regardless of personal beliefs, but counters that lawyers also have a duty to the court and society, which precludes presenting false or insincere arguments.

Lines 7-11 state the scholars' opinion that lawyers should not judge defendants, as it is the court's role to determine guilt, and lawyers should act as advocates without expressing personal opinions.

Lines 28-31 assert that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false to the court and should not deny their client's guilt if they are certain of it. This is not a hypothetical situation or a direct opposition to the scholars' view, but a qualification or specialization of the scholars' broad argument. It agrees with the general principle but adds a specific scenario where a lawyer's obligation to the court and society should take precedence.

While the passage does suggest a potential reduction in the reliance on traditional retail stores, it does not indicate that publishers will entirely bypass distributors or all forms of retail outlets.

Choice D predicts a decreased demand for copy editors and book designers. This is not directly addressed in the passage, and it is unclear how the shift towards digital publishing and on-demand printing would specifically impact these roles.

Choice E states that the demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly. This is a reasonable inference based on the information provided. The passage mentions the elimination of physical inventory and the reduction of costs associated with traditional publishing, including printing and shipping books. As the industry moves towards digital publishing and on-demand printing, it is likely that the demand for book-grade paper will decrease.

","Thought: 
The author suggests that the two opposing viewpoints on crime deterrence are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach would include elements of both strategies.

The economic principle of utility maximization states that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility, which is influenced by the likelihood and severity of punishment, as well as the potential benefits of legal alternatives.

Statement A suggests that stronger punishments for repeat offenders will reduce recidivism, which aligns with the author's argument about the impact of increasing the expected cost of criminal activity through stricter law enforcement.

Statement B suggests that ending rehabilitation efforts may increase the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity. Rehabilitation can be seen as a way to increase the expected utility of lawful activity, which according to the author, should have a positive effect on reducing deliberate crimes.

Statement C directly applies the author's reasoning about the impact of decreasing the expected utility of lawful activity, suggesting that it would lead to an increase in deliberate crimes.

Statement D suggests that restricting access to economic institutions would increase the rate of deliberate crimes, which again aligns with the author's argument about the impact of reducing the expected utility of lawful activity.

Statement E directly contradicts the author's argument. The author suggests that stronger law enforcement, which increases the expected cost of criminal activity, should reduce deliberate crimes. Statement E suggests the opposite, that an increase in law enforcement will lead to an increase in deliberate crimes.

","Thought: 
The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to autobiographies of Native Americans that were written or recorded with the collaboration of non-Native American contributors. This process involved soliciting, translating, recording, and editing the life stories of Native Americans, resulting in a final product that reflects the influence of two different cultures.

Choice A is incorrect because it mentions artifacts and oral traditions, which are not specifically mentioned in the passage as part of the authorship process. While these may be sources of information, they don't convey the collaborative writing and recording process described in the passage.

Choice B is incorrect because it suggests that two individuals contribute equally to the finished product, which is not the case in ""bicultural composite authorship"" as described in the passage. The process involves Native Americans as the primary sources of the content, with non-Native Americans contributing to the solicitation, translation, recording, and editing phases.

Choice C is incorrect because while it mentions multiple cultural perspectives, it does not capture the collaborative process described in the passage. The identities of the contributors are not the focus of the phrase; instead, it's the act of collaboration between individuals from different cultures that shapes the authorship.

Choice D is correct. It accurately conveys the process described in the passage, where the content originates from one culture (Native American) and is then edited and revised by individuals from another culture (non-Native American). This collaborative process results in a final product that reflects the influence of both cultures.

Choice E is incorrect because it does not capture the full extent of the collaboration described in the passage. While oral communication is mentioned, the phrase also encompasses the translation, recording, and editing phases that involve non-Native American contributors.

Therefore, choice D is the correct answer.

  D: A name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community.

","Thought: 
The author describes pre-contact Native American cultures as having a sense of self that was inclusive and relational to society, specific landscapes, and the cosmos. This means that an individual's identity was closely tied to their community and the natural world. 

Now, let's evaluate the choices:
Choice A describes a person born into one tribe but brought up by another, retaining a name from their birth tribe. This could indicate a sense of individual identity being tied to one's birth community, which is consistent with the described cultural perspective. 

Choice B mentions a pictograph representing a specific person, incorporating a symbol for a constellation. This doesn't directly relate to the described cultural perspective of a relational identity. 

Choice C suggests that a ritual for assuming a new name is shared across diverse communities. This doesn't reflect the cultural perspective described, as it lacks the unique relational aspect to the individual's specific community and landscape. 

Choice D states that names within a community are unique and not repeated, which doesn't directly relate to the described cultural perspective of identity. 

Choice E mentions a decorated shield that cannot be traced to a particular tribe. This goes against the idea of identity being relational to one's specific community and cultural context. 

Choice A is the most consistent with the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures' perspective on identity.
