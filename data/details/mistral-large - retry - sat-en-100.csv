","Thought:
The previous question was about the base pairing in DNA, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. So, the percentages of adenine and thymine should be equal, as should the percentages of guanine and cytosine.
Looking at the table for sea urchin DNA, the percentage of cytosine is 17.3% and the percentage of guanine is 17.7%. These percentages are not equal, so choice A cannot be correct. The percentage of thymine is 32.1%, which is not equal to either 17.3% or 17.7%, so choices B and C cannot be correct. The percentage of adenine is 32.8%, which is also not equal to either 17.3% or 17.7%, so choice D cannot be correct.
However, the question asks for evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, which was about base pairing. The percentages of adenine and thymine are not equal, but they are close (32.8% and 32.1%), as are the percentages of guanine and cytosine (17.7% and 17.3%). This suggests that there may be some variation in the base pairing, but overall the base pairing rule still holds.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer because it gives the percentage of cytosine (17.3\%) in sea urchin DNA and the percentage of guanine (17.7\%) in sea urchin DNA. Their near similar pairing supports the authors' proposal that possible pairings of nitrogenous bases are ""adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine"" (line 35).Choices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Choice $B$ (cytosine and thymine), Choice $\mathrm{C}$ (cytosine and adenine), and Choice $\mathrm{D}$ (guanine and adenine) are retry because they show pairings of nitrogenous bases that do not compose a similar percentage of the bases in sea urchin DNA.",D,A,0,1583,321,1904,

The narrator is described as noticing everything in the shop so she could later tell GaoLing what she had seen and tease out her envy. She also describes the shop in detail, including the polished floors, shiny glass cases, and silk-wrapped boxes.

According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is retry because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth.

If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is retry because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is retry.
