","Thought: 
The authors of Passage 1 argue that women's roles are distinct from men's, and they emphasize the importance of women's roles in the home and in raising children. They do not suggest that these roles are less valuable than men's roles, nor do they suggest that these roles are easy or pleasant. They also do not compare these roles to running a country or a business. Therefore, none of the options A, B, C, or D accurately reflect the authors' views as presented in Passage 1.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In lines 25-30, the authors of Passage 1 state that women should seek ""gentle occupations and the cares of the home"" so they can avoid performing difficult, or ""strenuous,"" and unpleasant, or ""onerous,"" tasks.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors of Passage 1 do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for both sexes, yield less value for society, or require professional or political skills.",A,C,0,1341,112,1453,

The passage starts with Ken Dial observing young birds and deciding to conduct an experiment. However, the initial setup of the experiment was not successful, as the birds did not behave as expected. After receiving advice from a rancher, Dial modified the experiment by adding hay bales for the birds to perch on. This led to the unexpected finding that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up the hay bales. Dial then interpreted these findings and proposed a new hypothesis, called WAIR, which he went on to document in a wide range of species. Therefore, the sequence of events in the passage is best reflected by choice D.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing how baby Chukars learn to fly. During the experiment, Dial noticed the unusual way Chukars use their ""'wings and legs cooperatively'"" to scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created ""a series of ingenious experiments"" (line 46) to study this observation. After his additional experiments, Dial determined that these baby birds angle ""their wings differently from birds in flight"" (lines 49-50).Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the sequence of events in the passage.",D,D,1,1290,139,1429,

The narrator is described as observing her surroundings in great detail, from the condition of the shop to the interactions between her father and the customer. She also mentions wanting to remember everything to tell GaoLing later, indicating she is very attuned to her immediate surroundings. 
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage.

The passage mentions that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops were planted, they might compete with the weeds, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control.

In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.
