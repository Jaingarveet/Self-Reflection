  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","You're right, let me take another look at this question and carefully follow the problem-solving steps.
1. The question asks which of the four pathogens infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
2. The relevant data is in the table showing pathogen occurrence in honey bee colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
3. To answer the question, I need to look at the ""Colonies without colony collapse disorder (%)"" column. This column shows the percentage of colonies without CCD that were affected by each pathogen.
4. Reading the data:
IAPV - 76%
KBV - 48% 
Nosema apis - 81%
Nosema ceranae - 0%
5. Comparing the percentages, Nosema apis has the highest value at 81% for colonies without CCD.
6. The answer choice that matches this is C: Nosema apis.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",C,D,0,1500,216,1716,

Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The question is asking specifically what percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder had bees infected by all four pathogens listed.
2. Looking at the table, the row headers list the individual pathogens, while the column headers distinguish between colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. The data shows the percentage of each colony type infected by each pathogen.
3. There is no explicit ""all four pathogens"" row, so I'll need to look at the individual pathogen percentages to determine the answer.
4. For colonies with colony collapse disorder, the relevant percentages are:
   Viruses: 83%, 100%, 90% 
   Fungi: 100%, 77%
5. For a colony to have all 4 pathogens, it would need to have the lowest of those individual percentages. Even if 100% had some pathogens, if only 77% had another, then at most 77% could have all 4.
6. The lowest percentage is 77% for Nosema ceranae fungus. So at most, 77% of collapse disorder colonies could have all 4 pathogens.
7. The answer choice that matches this is B: 77 percent.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",B,B,1,1511,294,1805,

  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The key point in Passage 1 is that the author believes the Constitution, which allows for both free and slave states, provides a good framework that has enabled the nation to grow and thrive. 
2. A few key quotes support this:
- ""It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased from four millions to thirty millions of people...""
- ""Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government.""
- ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?""
3. The author argues the Constitution works well as long as each state is allowed to regulate its own affairs regarding slavery. He believes this will allow the nation to continue expanding.
4. Choice A is not supported, as the author believes the Constitution does provide a way for free and slave states to coexist. Choices B and D are not the author's main point, even if the passage implies them. 
5. Choice C best summarizes the author's central argument - that the Constitution's allowance of slavery provides a good basic structure that does not need changing.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1402,297,1699,

","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","You're right, I previously answered this question incorrectly. Let me carefully re-examine the passage and reflect on the answer choices to determine the best response.
The key points I notice:
1. Akira's unscheduled visit to propose marriage to Naomi breaks tradition and startles Chie. The passage emphasizes the ""unseemliness"" of his abrupt proposal.
2. Akira apologizes for the ""disruption"" and acknowledges the ""unseemliness of this proposal"", showing he is aware his actions are inappropriate. 
3. Chie views Akira with ""maternal amusement"", seeing him as a child speaking with undue seriousness. This suggests she mistakes his earnestness for immaturity.
4. Akira states ""I don't want to trouble you"" and apologizes for taking up Chie's evening, indicating concern about imposing on her.
5. There is little direct evidence Chie doubts the sincerity of Akira's feelings. Her shock seems more about the impropriety of his actions.
Reflecting on this, the answer choice that best captures Akira's primary concern is A - he most fears Chie will consider his unscheduled proposal inappropriate, as it breaks tradition and propriety. While Chie does view him as immature (B), this seems secondary to Akira's worry about the ""unseemliness"" of his actions. Choices C and D are less supported by the passage.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",A,A,1,1662,339,2001,

","Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking about how the narrator is primarily portrayed throughout the passage. The key is to focus on her main, overarching traits rather than minor details.
2. Re-reading the passage, a few key details stand out about the narrator:
- She tries ""to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy."" This shows she is very observant of her surroundings. 
- She provides vivid descriptions of the shop - the dark polished wood floors, the shiny unbroken glass, how the ink boxes looked nicer than in the village. This further demonstrates her attunement to visual details.
- She pays close attention to and takes pride in her father's poetic sales pitch about the ink. She seems absorbed in studying the shop and the interaction.
3. The narrator's primary trait that emerges is that she is extremely attentive to and immersed in her immediate environment. She carefully studies the shop's appearance and her father's sales tactics, eager to take it all in. 
4. The other choices are not as strongly supported:
- While she is described as speaking in a ""shy voice"", overall the passage doesn't provide enough evidence that she is generally reserved around unfamiliar people. 
- She remembers Precious Auntie's lessons, but this seems more of a tangent rather than a defining trait. The passage doesn't focus on her sympathy for others.
- There are no signs that she feels anxious about responsibilities. She seems excited to be there and soak up the experience.
5. Choice B, ""attuned to her immediate surroundings"", best captures the narrator's defining characteristic based on the passage. Her keen observations and detailed descriptions of the shop demonstrate this.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",B,A,0,1420,410,1830,

","Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The first paragraph opens with ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition."" This sets up a contrast between Akira's actions and traditional expectations.
2. The next few sentences pose a series of questions: ""Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?"" These questions analyze Akira's untraditional approach and speculate about Chie's reaction to it.
3. The paragraph does mention cultural traditions like using a go-between, but describing the culture is not the main focus. It's more about Akira breaking those traditions.
4. The paragraph doesn't directly criticize the traditions, but rather questions and analyzes the impact of not following them in this specific situation with Akira and Chie.
5. The questions and analysis regarding Akira's direct approach and Chie's potential reaction suggest the main purpose is to analyze a reaction to his untraditional behavior.
Therefore, the best answer is:
Action: Answer(""D"")
The main purpose of the first paragraph is to analyze a reaction to Akira's untraditional approach in coming directly to Chie.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1618,284,1902,
