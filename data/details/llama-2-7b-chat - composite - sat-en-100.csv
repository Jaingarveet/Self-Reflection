","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A, ""Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately reflect the central tension between the two passages.

The correct answer is choice C, ""Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position."" The two passages present opposing views on the legality and morality of slavery, with Douglas arguing that the Constitution allows for the expansion of slavery and Lincoln arguing that the Constitution is inherently flawed in its treatment of slavery. This central tension is not addressed in the other choices.

In choice A, Douglas and Lincoln are presented as having different views on slavery, but the central tension between the two passages is not highlighted. In choice B, while Douglas expresses concerns about the economic impact of abolition, the central tension between the two passages is not focused on. In choice D, Douglas's interpretation of federal law conflicts with Lincoln's, but this does not accurately reflect the central tension between the two passages.

Advice: When answering this question, it is important to carefully read and analyze the two passages to identify the central tension between them. Choice C accurately reflects this central tension, while the other choices do not.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",,C,0,1415,320,1735,

Here is my reasoning:

The passage discusses the procession of educated men in English society and the importance of women joining this procession. It highlights the challenges faced by women in engaging with existing institutions and the need for them to make a decision about how to participate.

The passage describes how Ken Dial's observation of young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds led to a new discovery about the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate. Ken designed an experiment to measure the clues that might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly. The passage also mentions how Ken's son Terry was visibly upset when Ken returned from a short work trip, indicating that something significant had occurred during the experiment. This led Ken to realize that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, which opened up a world of possibilities for further study.

""I believe the main purpose of the passage is to emphasize the value of a tradition. The author seems to be highlighting the importance of the procession of educated men and the role it plays in society. The passage emphasizes the need for the author and others to join this procession and to think about the meaning of civilization and the ceremonies that are a part of it. The author's use of language and tone suggests that they are emphasizing the importance of this tradition and the need for others to appreciate it. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the main purpose of the passage is actually to stress the urgency of an issue. The author is not just emphasizing the importance of the tradition, but is also highlighting the need for immediate action. The passage creates a sense of urgency by using phrases such as 'we have very little time in which to answer them' and 'the moment is short.' This suggests that the author is trying to convey that the issue at hand is pressing and needs to be addressed quickly. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) stress the urgency of an issue.""

In this reflection, I analyzed the passage again and realized that my initial answer was incorrect. I identified the error keywords and analyzed the solution. I also followed the instructions provided and marked any information that I was not allowed to see as [REDACTED]. Finally, I provided advice on how to answer the question correctly in the future.","Choice B is the best answer. In this passage, Woolf asks women a series of questions.

  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","  Reflection:
I previously answered choice C, ""She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition,"" as the reaction Akira most fears from Chie. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.

From the passage, it is clear that Akira is eager to make a good impression on Chie and secure her approval for his proposal. He has come directly to the Fuji household, breaking a tradition, and has delivered his message with sincerity and formality. He has also shown respect for Chie's position by asking for her hand directly and offering to make her his ""yoshi"" (a term used to refer to a wife in a traditional Japanese marriage).

Therefore, the reaction that Akira most fears from Chie is choice B, ""She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity."" Akira is aware that Chie may view his proposal as premature or naive, and he is trying to convey his sincerity and maturity through his actions and words. If Chie mistakes his enthusiasm for immaturity, it could undermine his chances of securing her approval and winning Naomi's hand.

In conclusion, my self-reflection has helped me identify the correct answer to the question. I hope this reflection and explanation are helpful in answering the question correctly.","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal.

Initial Answer: B

Reasoning: Based on the passage, it seems that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would result in a higher percentage of the surface covered with weeds, as these crops would compete with the weeds for resources and space.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not provide enough information to support this answer. The passage only compares the percentage of surface coverage by weeds on the two agricultural strips, without providing any information on the growth and competition of wheat or corn. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.

[REDACTED]","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth.

Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect.

I previously answered question 2 as follows:
""Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is that men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.""
However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is actually:
""The rights of individuals are not determined by race or gender.""
This answer is supported by Grimké's argument that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that these rights are not based on differences of sex but on the diversity of our relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.

In conclusion, my previous answer was incorrect, and I have reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I hope this reflection helps me to provide a more accurate answer to the question in the future.

The passage explains that CT fibers are responsible for conveying a more emotional quality of touch, and that they are specifically activated when G.L.'s arm is gently brushed. This suggests that the stimulation of CT fibers is what allows for the emotional aspect of touch to be experienced. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.

Explanation:
Akira's demeanor towards Chie is not one of mocking disparagement. He is not making fun of Chie or belittling her position.

When answering the question, it is important to carefully read and analyze the passage to determine the tone and attitude of the character towards the speaker.

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]. The narrator describes the gold as needing nothing and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude, implying that Silas's obsession with the gold consumed him. This is the first mention of the gold in the passage, and it sets the tone for the narrator's representation of Silas's character before he adopted Eppie. The narrator highlights the gold's importance to Silas by describing it as something that required his constant attention and worship, indicating that Silas's obsession with wealth was all-consuming.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator describes Silas as having been so obsessed as to have felt required to worship the gold ""in close-locked solitude,"" with ""his thoughts in an ever-repeated circle"" centered on his hoard.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: displays the family's ink more impressively. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is option C: provides greater individual attention to customers.

The narrator highlights the difference between the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village and her family's ink shop by emphasizing the personalized attention given to customers in the latter. The narrator notes that Father had opened several of the boxes and was pointing to different sticks and cakes, indicating that he was taking the time to personally guide the customer in selecting the best ink for their needs. This level of individual attention is not present in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village, where the narrator simply watched Precious Auntie work without any direct interaction.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: The speed with which they climbed.

Here is my revised answer:
Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation: The passage suggests that the baby Chukars used their wings and legs in coordination to gain traction on steep ramps. The birds angled their wings differently from birds in flight and aimed their flapping down and backward, which allowed them to use the force of their flapping to help them climb. This is in contrast to option A, which suggests that the speed at which they climbed was the key factor in their traction.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. Dial observed that as the Chukars raced up steep ramps, they ""began to flap"" and ""aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force ... to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp"" (lines 49-53). Dial determined that the position of their flapping wings facilitated the baby Chukars' traction on the steep ramps.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the Chukars' speed, alternation of wing and foot movement, or continual hopping motions facilitated their traction on steep ramps.",C,B,0,1369,224,1593,

I realized that I made a mistake in my initial answer by assuming that clover does not produce pyrethrums. I should have known better since clover is a common food source for honeybees and is known to produce pyrethrums. I also realized that the authors of the passage are suggesting that the presence of pyrethrum-producing plants near honeybee colonies may help protect the bees from mite infestations, which is why they are assuming that the bees will be near wild-type honeybee colonies.

Throughout the passage, the narrator describes a visit to her family's ink shop. The narrator's father and uncles are employed at the shop, and in the third and fifth paragraphs the narrator describes her father's interactions with a customer. Her father praises the color, sound, and smell of an ink sample as indicators of the ink's quality.

Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice (C) as the best answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (B) The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.

Explanation:
Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that the acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. This assumption is supported by the observation that young birds in the wild prefer to rest on elevated perches, and that they only use the ground for feeding and traveling. By replicating this pattern in a controlled research setting, Ken Dial was able to observe how baby game birds learned to fly, and how they used their wings and legs cooperatively to climb vertical surfaces.

In contrast, choice (C) is not a accurate representation of Ken Dial's central assumption. While it is true that young birds in a controlled research setting may not require perches when at rest, this is not the central assumption of Ken Dial's research.

Choice (A) is also not a accurate representation of Ken Dial's central assumption, as the acquisition of flight in young birds does not necessarily shed light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors. While the study of flight in young birds can provide insights into the evolution of flight, it is not the primary focus of Ken Dial's research.

Finally, choice (D) is not a accurate representation of Ken Dial's central assumption, as there is no evidence to suggest that ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel. In fact, the evidence suggests that these two groups of animals evolved in different ways, with birds evolving from a group of small, feathered theropod dinosaurs.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (B) The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior, which is Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The author explains that Dial created his initial experiment to try and create ""new data on the age-old groundup-tree-down debate,"" and that he looked for ""clues"" in ""how baby game birds learned to fly"" (lines 8-11). The note at the beginning of the passage explains the ""age-old ground-up-tree down debate"" and offers two different theories on how birds evolved to fly.

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of himself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself.Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication that he generally does not spend time with his family. Choice $C$ is incorrect because although there are brief mentions of a diamond ring and manicured fingers, the paragraph focuses on Mr. Peters's overall appearance, not on his awareness of status symbols.

","  Topic: English

Reflection:
I previously answered question 70 incorrectly, selecting option A: has renounced all desire for money. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option C: seems more accepting of help from others.

The passage highlights how Silas' adoption of Eppie has led to a change in his perspective on life. He is no longer fixated on his own desires and needs, but rather is more attuned to the needs of others, particularly Eppie. The passage states, ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness"" (70). This suggests that Silas' mind is expanding and becoming more aware of his surroundings, including Eppie's needs.

Furthermore, the passage notes that Eppie's mischievous behavior presents a challenge for Silas, who is ""puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible demands of love"" (70). This suggests that Silas is struggling to balance his love for Eppie with his need to provide discipline and structure in her life. However, rather than renouncing all desire for money, as option A suggests, Silas seems more accepting of help from others, as indicated by the passage's mention of ""the tones that stirred Silas' heart grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers"" (60). This implies that Silas is more open to the idea of seeking help from others, such as Eppie's mother, to meet his daughter's needs.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option C: seems more accepting of help from others. This is supported by the passage's language and themes, which highlight Silas' growing awareness of his surroundings and his increasing willingness to seek help from others to meet Eppie's needs.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph, the narrator indicates that with the arrival of Eppie, Silas's thoughts turn from his work and his gold toward Eppie's future and his life with her: ""Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank limit - carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years."" By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage explains that Silas spends time outdoors after the arrival of Eppie, there is no indication that her presence has necessarily changed his understanding of his place in nature.

Passage 2 does not illustrate the practical difficulties of the proposal made in Passage 1, but rather takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.

The correct answer is choice B, ""Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1."" Passage 2 argues against the idea that women's duties are limited to the domestic sphere and that they cannot participate in public debates or exert coercive influences.

After re-reading the passages and analyzing the authors' arguments, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. Both authors agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities, and that these duties are not limited by their sex. They argue that women have the same moral nature as men and are therefore entitled to the same rights and responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Women have moral duties and responsibilities.

Explanation:
The first author, Grimké, argues that women have a moral nature that is equal to men's, and that this nature gives them the same rights and responsibilities as men. She rejects the idea that women are inherently inferior to men and argues that their duties and responsibilities are determined by their moral nature, not by their sex.

The second author, Grimké, also agrees that women have moral duties and responsibilities. She argues that the ethical obligations of women are often undervalued and that they are not given the same opportunities as men to exercise their moral agency. She believes that women have the same moral nature as men and are therefore entitled to the same rights and responsibilities.

In conclusion, both authors agree that women have moral duties and responsibilities, and that these duties are not limited by their sex. They argue that women have the same moral nature as men and are therefore entitled to the same rights and responsibilities. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Women have moral duties and responsibilities.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

I previously answered question 65 incorrectly, selecting choice D: Sempere was a friend of the book's author.

This does not directly imply that Sempere was a friend of the book's author.

I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option D: source of envy for people in other countries. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually suggests that the United States' resources and immensity are a divine gift to the American people, as stated in option C.

Here's my reasoning:

* In the first paragraph, Beveridge describes the United States as a ""noble land"" that God has given to the American people. This language suggests that the country's resources and immensity are a divine gift.
* Throughout the passage, Beveridge emphasizes the idea that the United States is a unique and exceptional nation, with a special destiny to fulfill. This destiny is tied to the country's resources and immensity, which are seen as a source of strength and power.
* The passage also highlights the idea that the United States is a beacon of hope and liberty for other nations, with Beveridge stating that the country's laws will cover Hawaii and Porto Rico with justice and safety, and that the Filipinos will ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the Stars and Stripes. This suggests that the United States is seen as a model for other nations, and that its resources and immensity are a source of inspiration and pride.

Therefore, based on the language and ideas presented in the passage, the correct answer is option C: divine gift to the American people.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge portrays America as ""a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe.""

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not accurate.

Tocqueville and Mill have different views on the proper position of individuals in society. Tocqueville argues that society should be organized in such a way that each individual can fulfill their natural destiny, which is determined by their sex. He believes that men and women have different natural roles in society, and that these roles should be respected. On the other hand, Mill argues that an individual's position in society should be determined by their abilities and capacities, regardless of their sex.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice (C) Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.

Advice:

When answering this question, it is important to carefully read and understand the passages provided. Both Tocqueville and Mill have unique perspectives on the proper position of individuals in society, and it is essential to accurately convey their views in your answer. Additionally, it is important to reflect on your own understanding of the passages and to ensure that your answer accurately represents the authors' ideas.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question by selecting option A, ""The second trigger produces an electrical charge that reverses the charge produced by the first trigger."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage does not mention anything about an electrical charge being produced by the second trigger. Instead, it suggests that the second trigger hair causes a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions, which is what ultimately leads to the closure of the trap. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, ""The second trigger prompts the calcium channels to open.""

Explanation:
The passage explains that when a trigger hair is touched, it causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap. This increase in calcium concentration is what ultimately leads to the closure of the trap. The second trigger hair is necessary to push the total concentration of calcium over the threshold required to close the trap. If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost. Therefore, option C is the best explanation for why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The third paragraph explains that touching a single trigger hair results in ""a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions"" in the plant. The fourth paragraph further explains that the calcium concentration produced by this initial touch isn't enough to cause the trap to close, but that a second hair touch will bring the total concentration to the level necessary to close the trap: ""a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.""Choices A and B are incorrect because the fourth paragraph explains that the second trigger supplements the action of the first trigger, not that it reverses it (choice (A)or stabilizes its effect (choice B).

The passage describes the author standing on a bridge over the River Thames, observing the procession of educated men passing by. The author notes that they themselves are part of this procession, and that they must think about the meaning of this procession and their place in it. The author suggests that the bridge represents a connection to the past and present sons of educated men, and that it is a symbol of their legacy.

Context: The Alcazar Restaurant was on Sheridan Road near Devon Avenue. It was long and narrow, with tables for two along the walls and tables for four down the middle. The decoration was art moderne, except for the series of murals depicting the four seasons, and the sick ferns in the front window. Lymie sat down at the second table from the cash register, and ordered his dinner. The history book, which he propped against the catsup and the glass 10 sugar bowl, had been used by others before him. Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body; also with names and messages no longer clear and never absolutely legible. On nearly every other page there was some marginal notation, either in ink or in very hard pencil. And unless someone had upset a glass of water, the marks on page 177 were from tears. While Lymie read about the Peace of Paris, signed on the thirtieth of May, 1814, between France and the Allied powers, his right hand managed again and again to bring food up to his mouth. Sometimes he chewed, sometimes he swallowed whole the food that he had no idea he was eating. The Congress of Vienna met, with some allowance for delays, early in November of the same year, and all the powers engaged in the war on either side sent plenipotentiaries. It was by far the most splendid and important assembly ever convoked to discuss and determine the affairs of Europe. The Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Kings of Bavaria, Denmark, and Wurttemberg, all were present in person at the court of the Emperor Francis I in the Austrian capital. When Lymie put down his fork and began to count them off, one by one, on the fingers of his left hand, the waitress, whose name was Irma, thought he was through eating and tried to take his plate away. He stopped her. Prince Metternich (his right thumb) presided over the Congress, and Prince Talleyrand (the index finger) represented France. A party of four, two men and two women, came into the restaurant, all talking at once, and took possession of the center table nearest Lymie. The women had shingled hair and short tight skirts which exposed the underside of their knees when they sat down. One of the women had the face of a young boy but disguised by one trick or another (rouge, lipstick, powder, wet bangs plastered against the high forehead, and a pair of long pendent earrings) to look like a woman of thirty-five, which as a matter of fact she was. The men were older. They laughed more than there seemed any occasion for, while they were deciding between soup and shrimp cocktail, and their laughter was too loud. But it was the women's voices, the terrible not quite sober pitch of the women's voices which caused Lymie to skim over two whole pages without knowing what was on them. Fortunately he realized this and went back. Otherwise he might never have known about the secret treaty concluded between England, France, and Austria, when the pretensions of Prussia and Russia, acting in concert, seemed to threaten a renewal of the attack. The results of the Congress were stated clearly at the bottom of page 67 and at the top of page 68, but before Lymie got halfway through them, a coat that he recognized as his father's was hung on the hook next to his chair. Lymie closed the book and said, ""I didn't think you were coming.""

Answer: C) Lymie finally closes the history book because he has finished the chapter about the Congress.

Explanation:
Lymie's reading is interrupted by the arrival of a party of four at the next table, and he becomes distracted by their loud laughter and the women's high-pitched voices. He then realizes that he has finished the chapter about the Congress and closes the book.

However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.

Explanation:
Passage 1 mentions that water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield, and that splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel, so ice-rich asteroids could become interplanetary refuelling stations. This implies that water will become increasingly valuable in space as it becomes scarce on Earth.

Additionally, Passage 2 mentions that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth, and that the gains made in space may be insecure without consensus on the for-profit exploitation of space. This suggests that resources that are valuable in space may become more valuable as they become scarce on Earth.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) They may increase in value as those same resources become rare on Earth.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet. Passage 2 says this explicitly in lines 74-76: ""The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth."" Meanwhile Passage 1 suggests that water mined from space may be more valuable than metals or other earth elements when creating an ""off-plant economy"" lines 25-30).Choice B is incorrect because neither passage discusses, either implicitly or explicitly, the need for space mining to be inexpensive.

The passage states that ""In normal subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices were activated, but only the insular cortex was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm."" This suggests that the physical dimensions of the somatosensory cortex are different in G.L. compared to normal subjects.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the data provided in the table do not directly support this claim. While it is true that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, this does not necessarily imply that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.

The table only provides information on the prevalence of four pathogens in colonies with and without colony collapse disorder. It does not provide information on the potential mechanisms by which these pathogens may be affecting the colonies. For example, it is possible that the varroa mites are directly killing bees, which then makes the colonies more susceptible to secondary infections. However, without additional data or analysis, it is not possible to draw a conclusive link between varroa mite infection and increased susceptibility to secondary infections.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder."" This answer choice accurately reflects the information provided in the table and recognizes the potential mechanisms by which pathogens may be affecting colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer.

Initial Answer: B

After reflecting on my initial answer, I realized that the information provided in the passage does not support the claim that the authors are presenting an alternate hypothesis about the composition of a nucleotide. The passage is focused on the structure of DNA and the authors are presenting evidence to support their conclusion that DNA consists of two chains held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases. The information about X-ray evidence and density is provided to support this conclusion and to rule out alternative explanations for the observed properties of DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) provide support for the authors' claim about the number of chains in a molecule of DNA.

Hodick and Sievers's model proposes that the Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf, and Volkov's experiment did not directly challenge this aspect of the model.

Explanation:
In Passage 2, Lincoln emphasizes that the controversy over slavery has been caused by attempts to spread it into new territory, rather than by the natural differences between states.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage does not provide any information to support this answer. In fact, the passage highlights that the Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to close, which is the correct answer.

Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer(""D"")

The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to close, which means that it will not close unless both trigger hairs are touched. This ensures that the plant does not waste energy on unimportant prey, only closing when it is sure that the insect is large enough to be worth its time. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",D,C,0,1401,181,1582,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option B, ""criticize a tradition."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as stated in option C. The speaker is expressing surprise and amusement at the young man's bold move and is curious about the possibility of Naomi accepting his proposal.

Self-Reflection:
I realized that I misunderstood the context of the passage and misinterpreted the speaker's tone. I should have been more careful in my analysis and paid closer attention to the language used in the passage.

Answer:
The main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as stated in option C, ""question a suggestion."" Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Question a suggestion.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",,D,0,1579,175,1754,
