Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
All the materials listed can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Steel cans and glass bottles can be melted down and remade into new cans and bottles many times. Paper and plastic degrade each time they are recycled, so they can't be reused as many times.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost forms when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice). This process is called sublimation.

After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought: 
To strengthen the conclusions of a scientific study, it is important to have the results independently verified. This helps to eliminate bias and confirm the results. Therefore, asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic would be the best way to strengthen the researchers' conclusions.

  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves making a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, observing the results, and then refining the hypothesis if necessary. If Michelle's results did not match her hypothesis, she should reconsider her hypothesis in light of the new data. This could involve changing the hypothesis to better fit the results, or considering if there were any errors in the experiment that could have led to the unexpected results.
