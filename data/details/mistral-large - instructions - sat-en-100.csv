Explanation:
The task is to identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. To find the answer, we need to look at the table and focus on the column for colonies without colony collapse disorder. The answer choices are IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, and Nosema ceranae. Looking at the table, we can see that the highest percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder were infected with Nosema ceranae. Therefore, the correct answer is ""D: Nosema ceranae"".","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",D,D,1,1505,132,1637,

","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent

","The question asks for the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder where honeybees were infected by all four pathogens.

Looking at the table, we can see that the row labeled ""All four pathogens"" shows the percentage of colonies affected by all four pathogens for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.

For colonies with colony collapse disorder, the percentage is listed as 100%.

Therefore, the answer is ""D: 100 percent"".","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",,B,0,1608,108,1716,

","Thought:
The interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord is brief and occurs when Ralphord asks about Barnard College, which Miss Spivey had attended. Miss Spivey corrects Ralphord's mispronunciation and explains that it is a sister school of Columbia University, assuming that the students have heard of it.
The main purpose of the interaction is to show that Miss Spivey has high expectations and assumptions about the students' knowledge, which may be unrealistic given their background and location in Threestep, Georgia.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. In the second paragraph, Miss Spivey tells her class that she went to Barnard College in New York City, which prompts Ralphord to ask her what she studied at ""Barnyard College."" In response, Miss Spivey explains that Barnard College ""was the sister school of Columbia University, of which, she expected, we all had heard."" This interaction implies that, contrary to Miss Spivey's expectations, the names of prestigious East Coast schools aren't common knowledge among her pupils. Thus the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord serves mainly to suggest that Miss Spivey has an exaggerated view of what information should be considered common knowledge.Choice B is incorrect because the interaction between Miss Spivey and Ralphord establishes an atmosphere of misunderstanding, not friendliness. Choice C is incorrect because Ralphord's question demonstrates his naivety rather than his precociousness.

The previous question was about the base pairing in DNA, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. So, the correct answer should be a pair of percentages that correspond to one of these base pairs.

Looking at the table for sea urchin DNA, the percentage of adenine is 32.8%, thymine is 32.1%, guanine is 17.7%, and cytosine is 17.3%.

The correct pair of percentages should correspond to either adenine and thymine or guanine and cytosine.

Action: Answer(""B"") (as 17.3% corresponds to cytosine and 32.1% corresponds to thymine, which are not a pair, and 17.7% corresponds to guanine and 32.8% corresponds to adenine, which are also not a pair, the correct answer must be 17.3% corresponding to cytosine and 32.8% corresponding to guanine, which are a pair)","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer because it gives the percentage of cytosine (17.3\%) in sea urchin DNA and the percentage of guanine (17.7\%) in sea urchin DNA.

The narrator is described as someone who is observant of her surroundings, taking note of the details of the shop and the people in it. She is also shown to be proud of her family's ink and the way her father speaks of it. She does not seem to be particularly reserved, sympathetic, or anxious in this passage.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit.

Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect.

The main focus of the first paragraph is to describe a culture, specifically the traditional Japanese custom of using a go-between in arranging marriages. The paragraph presents a situation where Akira breaks tradition by coming directly to Chie's house to ask for Naomi's hand in marriage, and questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if he had followed the traditional custom. However, the main purpose of the paragraph is not to criticize the tradition, question a suggestion, or analyze a reaction, but rather to describe the cultural context in which the story takes place.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.
