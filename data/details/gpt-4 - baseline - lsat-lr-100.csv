  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.

The reasoning in the context is about making a choice between two options based on a certain condition. If both conditions are equal, a third condition is used to make the choice. The choice that most closely follows this reasoning is E. In E, the rabbit has two options to avoid predators: double back or flee for cover. If one option is not available (no nearby cover), the rabbit will choose the other option (double back).

The physician's argument is based on the results of an experiment. The strongest counter to this argument would be something that undermines the validity of the experiment itself. Choice A suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving a treatment could have influenced their perception of pain, which could have skewed the results of the experiment.

The argument is based on the assumption that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely from Flynn Heights because more cocker spaniels are registered there. To evaluate this argument, it would be useful to know if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If they are, it could mean that there are actually more cocker spaniels in other neighborhoods, but they are just not registered. This would weaken the argument.
