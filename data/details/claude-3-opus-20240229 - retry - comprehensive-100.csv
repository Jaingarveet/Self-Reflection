  B: 13x/2 - 6
  C: 13x/24
  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are x pickets in total.
   So the total width of all the pickets is (1/2)x inches.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
   There is one less space than the number of pickets.
   So the total space between pickets is 6(x-1) inches.
3) The total length of the fence is the width of the pickets plus the space between them.
   Total length in inches = (1/2)x + 6(x-1)
                          = (1/2)x + 6x - 6
                          = (13/2)x - 6
4) We need to convert the length from inches to feet.
   There are 12 inches in a foot.
   Total length in feet = ((13/2)x - 6) / 12
                        = (13x - 12) / 24
Therefore, the correct answer is (13x-12)/24.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed.
2. To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time:
   Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
3. Now, we know it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point. 
4. Since speed = distance / time, we can rearrange this to find the length:
   Length = Speed * Time
   Length = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 meters
5. 87.5 meters rounds to 75 meters, which is choice B.

A: Increased protection efforts and awareness would support the expert opinion, not raise doubts about it.
B: Decreased rainfall and groundwater levels affecting the salamanders' water source environment provides an alternative explanation for the population decline, raising doubts about the trampling theory.
C: If the salamanders hide under rocks during the day and avoid cattle and sheep, that would raise doubts about the trampling explanation, as the salamanders may not be as exposed and vulnerable as suggested.
D: The salamanders being in an inaccessible mountainous location, preventing tourist entry, is not directly relevant to the cattle and sheep trampling theory. It doesn't provide strong evidence for or against it.

   - Nina on Monday, Robert on Wednesday
   - Nina on Wednesday, Robert on Monday
3. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday (along with George). But there are only 2 slots per day, so this is not possible.
4. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday. 
5. This means Robert must give his report on Monday morning (since he can't give an afternoon report).

   - Top shelf: 2 books
   - Middle shelf: 2 or 3 books  
   - Bottom shelf: 3 or 4 books
3. The question states that G is on the top shelf. So there is 1 unknown book on the top shelf with G.
4. I must be on the middle shelf per the conditions. So the middle shelf contains I and 1-2 other books.
5. K must be on a higher shelf than F. Since F is on the same shelf as M, K must be above both F and M. 
   - If F and M are on the bottom, K could be on the top or middle.
   - If F and M are on the middle, K must be on the top.

2. The passage also says there is no such thing as a cat that cannot provoke allergic reactions at all, since all cats shed skin and spread saliva. However, it notes that a particular cat often causes reactions in some, but not all, people with cat allergies. 
3. This directly supports choice B - no single cat will cause allergic reactions in every person with a cat allergy, because different allergy sufferers are sensitive to different cat proteins.
4. Choice A is not supported, as the passage discusses individual cats, not cat breeds. Choices C and D are not directly addressed.

1. The economics professor concludes that Checkers refused the coupons solely to hurt Marty's Pizza. 
2. The professor bases this on the fact that accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied some of its potential customers.
3. So for the professor's conclusion to be properly drawn, we need to assume that if a company refuses to accept competitor coupons when doing so would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers, the only possible motive is to hurt the competitor.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This matches the assumption we identified in step 3. If we assume this, the professor's conclusion logically follows.
B) This is the reverse of what we need. It says if a company wants to hurt a competitor, it will refuse the coupons even when acceptance costs nothing and satisfies customers. But we need the reverse implication.
C) This just says at least one company has done this, not that it's the only possible motive. Doesn't enable the conclusion.
D) Not relevant, as the professor's conclusion is about Checkers' motive, not the effect on Marty's.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text about how to sell items on OLX. 
2. The given text is talking about registering as a user on the OLX website in order to create, edit and delete ads. It mentions visiting the OLX website by searching for ""olx (your country)"".
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This choice doesn't make much sense in the context. It's talking about hovering over a username, which doesn't fit with the registration process.
B) This choice logically follows the given text. After mentioning visiting the OLX site, the next step would be entering your information to create an account. It also mentions clicking the ""login"" button which aligns with creating an account.
C) This choice provides relevant information about how the exact OLX web address varies by country. However, it doesn't directly continue the process of registering as a user.
D) This choice mentions needing your name to register, which is relevant. But the last sentence about registering before selling your ID doesn't make sense.
4. Choice B provides the most coherent and likely continuation of the given text about the user registration process on OLX.

  B: stops drumming and shakes his head and smiles.
  C: writes on a napkin for two minutes.
  D: starts playing so hard his fingers are starting to bleed.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The guy is sitting with drumsticks in his hands. This suggests he is playing the drums.
2. The next sentence confirms he is playing the drums. 
3. Then, the guy stops playing and opens his mouth. What is the most likely thing someone would do after stopping playing drums and opening their mouth?
4. Looking at the choices:
   A. Placing the sticks on the drum is possible, but not the most likely action after opening his mouth.
   B. Stopping drumming, shaking his head and smiling suggests a reaction, likely to the drumming. This seems quite plausible after opening his mouth.
   C. Writing on a napkin for two minutes is not a likely immediate action after stopping drumming and opening his mouth.
   D. Playing so hard his fingers bleed doesn't make sense right after stopping and opening his mouth.
5. Choice B seems the most likely and natural continuation of the sequence of events described.

","Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Schielder
  C: Krasner and Rankow
  D: Vertucci
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question is asking about who classified root canal isthmuses. An isthmus in the root canal system is a narrow ribbon-shaped communication between two root canals.
2. Going through the answer choices:
   A. Kim - I don't recall Kim being associated with a root canal isthmus classification system.
   B. Schielder - Schielder is known for various endodontic concepts, but I don't believe he proposed an isthmus classification.
   C. Krasner and Rankow - This name sounds very familiar in relation to isthmus classification. I believe they proposed an anatomical classification of canal isthmuses.
   D. Vertucci - Vertucci is well known for his root canal classification system, but that relates more to the overall canal configuration rather than isthmuses specifically.
3. Based on my knowledge, Krasner and Rankow seems to be the most likely answer for who proposed a root canal isthmus classification system.
