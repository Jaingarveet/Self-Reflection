Let the original price of the laptop be $x$.
The discount reduces the price by 20%, so Alma paid 80% of the original price.
The price after the discount is $(0.8)x$.
The sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, so Alma paid $(1.08)(0.8)x$.
We know that Alma paid $p$ dollars, so we can set up the equation $(1.08)(0.8)x = p$ and solve for $x$.

The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars.

The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$.

Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$.

To determine if the system has no solution, we need to check if the two equations represent parallel lines.
We can do this by checking if the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional.

Since there are 100 regions in the entire field, we can estimate the total number of earthworms by multiplying the average number of earthworms per region by the total number of regions.

","Thought:
The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is a linear function.
The slope of the function can be calculated as the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\frac{\$51.59-\$16.94}{40-5}=\frac{\$34.65}{35}=0.99$.
The y-intercept of the function is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is $\$16.94$.
Therefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+\$16.94$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice B is correct. Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

Next, we can use the given information to write two equations relating the number of right-handed female students (Rf) and right-handed male students (Rm) to Lf and Lm:
Rf = 5Lf  (there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students)
Rm = 9Lm  (there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students)

From the problem, we know that if each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, there will be 5 milliliters left over.
So, we can set up the equation: n = 3s + 5.
We also know that if each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl will need an additional 21 milliliters.

Therefore, the category that accounts for approximately 19 percent of all the survey respondents is males taking Geometry. 
Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. From the table, there was a total of 310 survey respondents, and $19 \%$ of all survey respondents is equivalent to $\frac{19}{100} \times 310=58.9$ respondents. Of the choices given, 59 , the number of males taking Geometry, is closest to 58.9 respondents.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the number of males taking Geometry is closer to 58.9 (which is $19 \%$ of 310 ) than the number of respondents in each of these categories.",C,C,1,626,173,799,

","Thought:
The coefficient 1.88 is multiplying the length $L$ of the femur, which means that it represents the approximate increase in height $H$ for each one-inch increase in femur length $L$. 
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. It's given that $L$ is the femur length, in inches, and $H$ is the height, in inches, of an adult male. Because $L$ is multiplied by 1.88 in the equation, for every increase in $L$ by 1 , the value of $H$ increases by 1.88. Therefore, the meaning of 1.88 in this context is that a man's height increases by approximately 1.88 inches for each oneinch increase in his femur length.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect and may result from misinterpreting the context and the values the variables are representing.",C,D,0,515,52,567,

","Thought:
To solve the system of equations, we can use the substitution method.
From the second equation, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$ as $x=2y+19$.
Substituting this expression for $x$ into the first equation, we get $3(2y+19)+4y=-23$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $10y=-80$, which implies $y=-8$.
Substituting this value of $y$ into the expression for $x$, we get $x=2(-8)+19=-5$.
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(-5,-8)$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are incorrect because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",A,B,0,450,152,602,
