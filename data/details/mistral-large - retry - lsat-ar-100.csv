Since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one witness for Monday. Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, so they cannot both testify on Tuesday. Hong cannot testify on Monday, so they must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.

If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco and Garcia must both testify on Wednesday, which is not possible since Iturbe is already scheduled for Wednesday. Therefore, Jackson cannot be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

If Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday, then Franco must testify on Monday. But Hong cannot testify on Monday, so this is not possible. Therefore, Garcia and Hong cannot both be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two spaces between the two restaurants.
Option A states that a restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5. This would ensure that there is at least one space between the two restaurants, but it does not guarantee that there will be at least two spaces between them.
Option B states that a restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This does not guarantee that there will be at least two spaces between the two restaurants.

Option D states that no more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it. This does not guarantee that there will be at least two spaces between the two restaurants.

Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #4.

Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Thus, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.

Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, they cannot review the play Jiang reviews. Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays. Since Megregian cannot review the play Jiang reviews, Megregian must review Tamerlane and the other play that Kramer and Lopez do not review. If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Megregian must review Undulation, and if Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must review Sunset. Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review the same play as either Kramer or O'Neill. Since Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, Megregian must review the same play as Kramer. Therefore, Megregian must review Sunset.

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Zone 1 must have the most sales representatives.
If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 1 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that Zone 1 has the most sales representatives.
If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Zone 2 would have only one sales representative, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

The conditions state that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days, and any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 7. This means that the breed of puppy featured on day 7 must be either a Newfoundland or a Rottweiler. However, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, so it must be a Newfoundland.

Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1, they must be featured on some combination of days 2-6. They cannot be featured on any day that features Rottweilers, so they must be featured on days that feature either Greyhounds or Newfoundlands. Since Greyhounds are only featured on day 1, Himalayans must be featured on days that feature Newfoundlands.

Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the nine batches must be distributed among the other four days.
Monday already has at least one batch, and since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, Monday can have at most three batches.
If Monday had three batches, then the remaining six batches would have to be distributed among Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, with at least two batches on each day. However, this is not possible since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so Thursday already has one batch and cannot have more than three.
Therefore, Monday must have either one or two batches.
If Monday had only one batch, then Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday would have to have at least two batches each, which is not possible since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
Therefore, Monday must have exactly two batches.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, these two batches must be made on Monday.
The remaining batch for Monday must be a sugar cookie batch, which means that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.

A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is not possible since I is already on the middle shelf, and F and M must be on the same shelf.

The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, because that would mean that both the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Thursday, which is not possible since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day (D is retry).

L must be shown after K and before M, so it cannot be the first house shown.

Since J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
If J is the sixth house shown, then K, L, and M must be shown in the afternoon since they cannot be shown in the morning and L must be shown between K and M.
If J is the seventh house shown, then K, L, and M can be shown in either the afternoon or evening, but they must still be shown in the order K, L, M.

Choice A says that K is shown at some time after J is shown, but this cannot be true since J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
Choice B says that L is shown at some time after J is shown, but this cannot be true since L must be shown between K and M and J must be shown in the evening.
Choice C says that P is shown at some time after J is shown, which could be true if J is the sixth house shown and P is the seventh house shown.
Choice D says that both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown, which could be true if M is the fifth house shown and N and O are the sixth and seventh houses shown.
Choice E says that both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, which could be true if K is the third house shown and N and P are the sixth and seventh houses shown.

Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh
","Choices:
  A: first or second
  B: second or third
  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh
","Thought:
If O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F (since O is not performed immediately before F), so T must be performed immediately after R. This means that F must be performed after R. Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and F is performed after R, at least two compositions must be performed after F and before R. Since O is performed fifth, and O is performed immediately after T, which is performed immediately after R, R must be performed fourth. Therefore, F must be performed either sixth or seventh.
