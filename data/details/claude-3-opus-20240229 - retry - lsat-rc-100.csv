  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The third paragraph discusses critics of the second version of multicultural education. These critics argue that using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
2. The critics believe that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of that culture itself, which are often non-scientific. 
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This study compares moral codes but doesn't specify the methods used, so it's unclear if the critics would object.
B) Using a culture's own literature to understand its values aligns with the critics' view, so they likely wouldn't object.
C) This directly describes what the critics are objecting to - using Western scientific methods to study a non-scientific culture. 
D) The critics may object to imposing one culture's theories on another's literature, but it's not certain.
E) The critics are concerned about imposing Western methods on other cultures, not the reverse, so they may not object to this.
4. Choice C most clearly matches the kind of study the third paragraph critics would find objectionable.

  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage presents three positions on the role of literature:
   - Art should stand above everyday reality
   - Art should expose injustice and contribute to creating a new society (the ""radical view"")
   - Dostoyevsky's view, which sees no distinction between fantasy and reality, and believes the task of the writer is to ""explode the boundaries of the so-called real world""
2. After introducing these three positions in the first paragraph, the rest of the passage focuses on elaborating and differentiating Dostoyevsky's view from the radical view. 
3. The passage goes into detail on Dostoyevsky's disagreements with the radical view, such as:
   - The radical view that reality should be depicted ""as it is"" was meaningless to Dostoyevsky, who believed reality was shaped by the person experiencing it
   - Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical view that art must serve a particular political view 
   - Dostoyevsky found the radical requirement that art must be ""useful"" to be unsatisfactory
4. In contrast, the first view (that art should stand above reality) is not discussed in any further detail after the first paragraph.
Therefore, the answer that best describes the organization of the passage is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) The key assertion in lines 11-16 is that Toni Morrison was the first African American author to use a musical genre (specifically jazz) as the structuring principle for an entire novel. 
2) To call this assertion into question, we would need evidence that some other African American author had done this before Morrison wrote Jazz in 1992.
3) Looking at the answer choices:
A) This would support, not call into question, the author's assertion. 
B) If true, this would directly contradict the assertion that Morrison was the first to structure a novel based on a musical genre. The blues predates jazz.
C) This is too broad - the assertion is specifically about African American authors, not all authors writing about the arts.
D) This is not relevant to the specific assertion about deliberately structuring a novel based on a musical genre.
E) This is also not directly relevant. The assertion is about the structure of the novel, not just having music-related plots and characters.

- Argues that fingerprint evidence should be accepted despite criticisms because it has been reliably used for a long time
- Acknowledges that more testing and standards could be beneficial, but rejects the idea of discarding fingerprint evidence entirely
- States that fingerprint examiners do follow consistent approaches and have low error rates based on training and peer review
Passage B: 
- Argues there is a lack of objective standards for declaring fingerprint matches
- Points out the lack of data on the probability of different people sharing fingerprint characteristics
- Questions the error rates of fingerprint examiners and cites issues with proficiency tests
The passages disagree on the reliability of fingerprint evidence, but they both emphasize the importance of knowing the probability of partial prints from different people matching in order to properly evaluate fingerprint evidence.
Passage A acknowledges this indirectly by saying ""further testing"" could be desirable. Passage B states it directly, saying the probability of matches is ""critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence.""

  D: pleased that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers
  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that defense lawyers have a twofold obligation - to the defendant, but also to the court and society (lines 20-23). 
2. The author argues that this twofold obligation means lawyers should not present assertions to the court that they know to be false, even if it would help their client's case (lines 23-26).
3. The author also argues that if lawyers are convinced their client is guilty, they should not try to demonstrate their innocence. Instead, they should argue for leniency in sentencing if warranted (lines 30-36).
4. However, if the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent, they should try to prove their innocence (lines 36-39).
5. The author states that this twofold obligation ""ultimately benefits the defendant"" because the best defense comes from a lawyer who is convinced of the merits of the case after analyzing the facts (lines 39-43).
Looking at the answer choices:
A fits best. The author is confident that the twofold obligation allows lawyers to balance their responsibilities to the court/society and to the defendant. The passage argues this balance ultimately benefits the defendant.
B, C, D and E are not supported by the passage. The twofold obligation doesn't necessarily prevent lawyers from representing guilty clients, help uncover facts, avoid interfering with defense strategies, or eliminate conflicts of interest.
Therefore, the best answer is A.

  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage states that ""Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.""
2. However, when experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons were conducted in the 1930s, ""researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context."" 
3. This suggests that the physics community in the 1930s neglected or did not seriously consider the earlier theoretical calculations showing atoms could potentially be split. They did not expect atom splitting to occur in the neutron bombardment experiments.
4. The passage does not indicate the physics community reevaluated the earlier calculations (B), never identified the byproducts of the experiments (C), showed uranium was easiest to split (D), or recognized the dangers of radioactive materials (E). 
5. Therefore, the best answer is that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments (A) suggesting atom splitting was possible, as they did not expect or recognize it was happening in the 1930s neutron bombardment experiments until Meitner's insight.

  E: Widespread familiarily with new ways of storing information will be the primary reason for the acceptance of the new digital model.
","To determine which statement the author would most likely agree with, I'll analyze the key points in the passage:
1. Digital publishing eliminates many costs associated with traditional publishing, like printing, warehousing, shipping, etc. This makes digital publishing much less expensive.
2. Once most books are digitized, any digitized book can be printed on demand, even those considered ""out of print."" This greatly expands the catalog of available books.
3. Under the digital model, authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds since many traditional publishing costs are eliminated. 
4. Established publishers may be slow to adopt the digital model since they are invested in traditional publishing infrastructure. Upstart digital publishers may bid for new manuscripts first.
5. Traditional publishers will need to reduce redundant functions and accommodate higher author royalties or risk losing authors.
The passage focuses mainly on the economic and logistical advantages of digital publishing over traditional. The ability to keep any book ""in print"" and the cost savings seem to be the main drivers of the transition the author envisions.
While literary agents demanding higher author royalties may put pressure on publishers, this seems more a consequence of the transition than the primary impetus behind it.
Therefore, of the given choices, B aligns best with the author's main argument - the ease of keeping books available via print-on-demand will be the primary factor driving the acceptance of the digital publishing model.

  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The passage states that proverb use within Mexican American communities serves several functions:
1. Instructing the young, especially in areas like table manners and peer-group relationships. This is said to be more prominent in Mexican traditions than English-speaking ones.
2. Fostering a consciousness of ethnicity and membership in a distinct ethnic group. Even proverbs without an explicit didactic purpose serve to transmit Spanish language and Mexican culture to younger generations, strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
3. Proverbs provide a link to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture.
Looking at the answer choices:
A is retry. The passage does not state or imply that maintaining ethnic ties is the primary purpose of proverbs used to teach table manners specifically.
B looks promising. The passage does state that proverb use, even proverbs without an explicitly didactic purpose, serves to transmit culture and enhance young people's familiarity with their Mexican heritage and ethnicity. 
C is not supported. The passage focuses on Mexican American proverb use and does not make claims about how it compares to proverb use by other Spanish speakers worldwide.
D is true based on the passage's definition of proverbs, but this is more of a background fact rather than a main implication of the passage as a whole.
E is unsupported. While the passage says emphasis on peer relationships may be greater in Mexican American communities, it does not say this definitively distinguishes them from all other U.S. communities.
Therefore, B appears to be the best answer. The passage most strongly implies that frequent proverb use in a community functions to convey a sense of ethnicity to the children in that community.

  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The sentence at lines 7-11 states the view of some legal scholars that a defense lawyer's sole obligation is to provide the best possible defense, regardless of the lawyer's personal opinion of the defendant's guilt or innocence. This is because in their view, determining guilt is the court's job, not the lawyer's.
2. The two sentences at lines 28-31 state that when lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, they should not try to demonstrate the defendant's innocence. Rather, they should argue the case as much as possible in the client's favor while giving due consideration to the facts on the other side. 
3. These two passages are expressing opposing viewpoints:
- Lines 7-11 argue that lawyers should disregard their personal opinion and provide the best defense possible. 
- Lines 28-31 argue that lawyers who know their client is guilty should not try to prove innocence, but argue for leniency.
4. Therefore, the relationship between the two passages is that the author is expressing their own opinion (in lines 28-31) that opposes the opinion of the legal scholars reported earlier (in lines 7-11).

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses the conflict between the concepts of the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (perfect competition). 
2. It states that for almost two centuries, economists favored the Invisible Hand concept because it was easier to represent mathematically, even though increasing returns obviously characterized many real-world enterprises.
3. The reference to railroads is given as an example of these real-world enterprises that exhibited increasing returns, i.e. had characteristics of the Pin Factory.
4. Economists repeatedly tried to bring the concept of the Pin Factory into mainstream economic thought to reflect the reality of industries like railroads, but failed because they couldn't represent the idea with mathematical rigor.
5. So the railroads example illustrates an industry with increasing returns, which economists recognized but struggled to incorporate into their models that assumed diminishing returns.
Therefore, the railroads example serves to ""call attention to the increasing prevalence of industries that have characteristics of the Pin Factory"" (choice C).
It does not resolve any ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor (A), illustrate the difficulty of stating the Pin Factory concept mathematically (B), point to shortcomings of the Invisible Hand emphasis (D), or present an example of high competition (E).

The key points in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education are:
1) The second version adopts a neutral stance regarding value differences between cultures. 
2) However, it still uses Western scientific methods to examine and understand other cultures.
3) These Western scientific methods are value-laden, prizing objectivity, logic, and empirical verification.
4) Insisting on using these methods to understand non-scientific cultures is distorting and Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
5) Real understanding requires adopting the often non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This doesn't address the key criticism. Even if true, it doesn't justify using Western scientific methods.
B) The similarity or dissimilarity of non-Western value systems is not relevant to the criticism about methodology. 
C) This provides a counterexample to the claim that using one's own methodological framework to study other cultures is necessarily distorting or chauvinistic. If some non-Western cultures do this, it suggests the practice is not uniquely Eurocentric or problematic.
D) The criticism is not concerned with Western cultures understanding their own achievements, so this point is not relevant.
