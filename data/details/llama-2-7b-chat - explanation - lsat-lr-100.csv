The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in revenue streams. Movie executives primarily rely on ticket sales to generate profits, which requires a large audience. In contrast, television executives rely on advertising revenue, which is generated through sponsorships. Sponsors are primarily concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which means they are more interested in attracting a loyal audience rather than maximizing the number of viewers. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the argument requires the assumption that an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.

Explanation:
The argument states that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting. This implies that a thorough understanding of composting is necessary for gardeners to effectively use compost in their gardens. The difference between hot and cold composting is a fundamental aspect of composting that gardeners should be aware of, as it affects the process and outcome of composting.

After reflecting on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer, I realize that the most similar argument to the one used by the radio producer is:

B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.

The reasoning used by the radio producer is similar to this argument in that both consider the practicality and feasibility of different options. The radio producer is faced with the dilemma of either devoting airtime to other, more popular genres of music or sticking with classical music that appeals only to a small but loyal audience. Both options have their pros and cons, and the radio producer must weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of each before making a decision. Similarly, in the argument provided, the speaker must weigh the convenience of buying blinds versus the time and effort required to make curtains, taking into account the non-standard sizes of the windows.

After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the correct answer is (C) Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.

Explanation:
The microbiologist's argument is that the bacteria that survive in sewage sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning due to their exposure to heavy metals in the sewage sludge. Option (C) supports this argument by suggesting that the bacteria's exposure to antibiotics in the sewage sludge contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning. This means that the bacteria's exposure to both heavy metals and antibiotics in the sewage sludge has promoted their resistance to both. Therefore, option (C) most strengthens the microbiologist's argument.

Similarly, in the argument above, it is stated that only a minority of people engage in political action out of a sense of social justice, and then concluded that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.

The argument above highlights the principle that justifiable punitive measures can only be taken against someone who has engaged in illegal activities, and not against someone who has been wronged by illegal means. In this case, the company obtained the evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations. Therefore, the company cannot justifiably take punitive measures against Ellison.

Explanation:
The statements provided suggest that both monstrous beast and mad scientist horror stories typically involve violations of the laws of nature and are intended to evoke dread in the reader. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].

Explanation for each choice:

[REDACTED]: All descriptions of monstrous beasts do not necessarily describe violations of the laws of nature. While many monstrous beasts are depicted as supernatural or unnatural creatures that defy the laws of nature, some may also be depicted as having a rational or scientific explanation for their existence.

[REDACTED]: This choice is incorrect because not all stories that describe a violation of a law of nature are intended to invoke dread in the reader. Some stories may describe scientific or natural phenomena in a neutral or informative manner, without intending to evoke an emotional response.

[REDACTED]: While some horror stories may involve psychologically disturbed characters, this is not a universal feature of all horror stories. Many horror stories involve ordinary people facing supernatural or monstrous threats, and these characters may not be psychologically disturbed.

[REDACTED]: This choice is incorrect because most stories about mad scientists do not express the author's antiscientific views. While some mad scientist stories may be critical of unchecked scientific progress or the dangers of playing God, many others simply depict a scientist who has gone mad or is pursuing unethical goals.

[REDACTED]: This choice is correct because some stories that employ symbolism may describe violations of the laws of nature, even if the story is not primarily focused on horror or supernatural elements. For example, a story that uses a monstrous beast as a symbol of a character's inner turmoil or psychological distress may still describe a violation of the laws of nature, even if the primary focus of the story is not horror.",,E,E,1,1033,444,1477,

  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that the correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town. This information weakens the argument that violent crime in the town is becoming a serious problem because it suggests that the root cause of the issue is not the overall number of violent crimes, but rather the actions of a small group of repeat offenders. If the town can identify and address the issues surrounding these repeat offenders, it may be able to reduce the overall number of violent crimes in the area.

Here's why the other options do not weaken the argument:

A) The town's overall crime rate appearing to rise slightly this year compared to the same period last year does not necessarily affect the argument. While it may indicate a broader trend in crime, it does not necessarily explain the specific issue of violent crime.

B) The age of the victim being a factor in the likelihood of being a victim of violent crime does not directly address the issue of violent crime in the town.

Question: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the correct answer is (C) The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.

Explanation:
The argument states that consumers who do not bother to acquire detailed information about a product they might purchase are behaving rationally. This means that the benefits of acquiring such information do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.

REDACTED:

(A) Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.

This option is not the correct answer because the argument does not state that rational consumers do not bother to acquire detailed information. Instead, it states that consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are behaving rationally.

(B) Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.

This option is also not the correct answer because the argument does not imply that it is irrational to acquire detailed information. Instead, it states that the benefits of acquiring such information do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.

(D) Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.

This option is partially correct, as the argument does state that rational consumers do not expect the benefits of acquiring detailed information to outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. However, this does not necessarily mean that consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are behaving irrationally.

(E) Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Mendota's argument is more convincing. While the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

Explanation:
Larew and Mendota are debating whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile can be accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Mendota argues that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile. This means that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

The correct answer is (C) No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back. The physician's argument is based on the results of the specific experiment conducted on patients with chronic back pain. However, if there is no evidence from other experiments that magnetic fields are effective in reducing pain in other areas, then the results of the experiment on back pain may not be generalizable to other types of pain.

Action: Answer(""D"")

Self-reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the argument. The argument is not claiming that high blood pressure causes a hypertensive personality, but rather that the combination of personality traits (nervousness and anxiety) is more likely to cause high blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) takes a correlation between personality traits and high blood pressure as proof that the traits cause high blood pressure.

Explanation:
The argument is based on the idea that people with high blood pressure are more likely to have certain personality traits, such as nervousness and anxiety. However, this correlation does not necessarily mean that the personality traits cause the high blood pressure. The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes a causal relationship between the personality traits and high blood pressure without providing evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) takes a correlation between personality traits and high blood pressure as proof that the traits cause high blood pressure.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting (A) It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is flawed because it uses affirming the antecedent, assuming that just because there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious, it follows that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers. This conclusion is not supported by any evidence or reasoning, and it ignores the possibility that some drivers in West Ansland may be unsafe despite the low accident rate.

Context: Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the runoff from Turkey's Birecik Dam, should have been left there. We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.

The archaeologist's argument is based on the idea that the absence of the mosaics at the site will mislead future archaeologists who may not have access to the records of the original excavation. By leaving the mosaics in their original location, future archaeologists can still observe and study the materials used in their construction, which is an important aspect of archaeological analysis.

Option (C) is the best answer because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I realized that the key to solving this problem is understanding the relationship between nicotine absorption and cigarette consumption. The correct answer is (C) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

Explanation:
The study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body's ability to absorb nicotine is not affected by the amount of nicotine in the cigarettes smoked. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the finding of the study is that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.

The other options do not explain the finding of the study:

(A) Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers are identical regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.

(B) Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes is irrelevant to the study's finding.

(D) The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes is also irrelevant to the study's finding.

(E) When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.

The flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above is:

B: Many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.

Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B - confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon

Analysis:

The argument suggests that crying reduces emotional stress because tears remove hormones from the body. However, this reasoning may be flawed because it assumes that the presence of hormones in tears is the sole cause of emotional stress, rather than one of many factors. It is possible that other factors, such as the body's natural response to stress or the emotional support of social interactions, play a more significant role in reducing emotional stress.

Correct Answer: C - fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well

Explanation:
The argument assumes a linear causal relationship between crying and emotional stress, where the removal of hormones from the body through tears is the sole cause of reduced emotional stress. However, this oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors that contribute to emotional stress and the potential feedback loops between these factors. It is possible that emotional stress can influence the production of hormones in tears, creating a feedback loop where emotional stress and hormone levels are interdependent. Therefore, the argument fails to adequately address this complexity and the potential influence of emotional stress on hormone production.",,,E,0,595,349,944,

","  Action: Answer(""E"")

The passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, which suggests that the population size of seals was relatively stable. However, the passage does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population. Therefore, it is possible that hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the seal population over the 800-year period studied, which supports choice (E).

The other options are not supported by the passage:

* Choice (A) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the variation in seal hunting practices between different groups of Native peoples in North America.
* Choice (B) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the correlation between body size and overall health of northern fur seals.
* Choice (D) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the effort made by Native peoples to limit their hunting of northern fur seals.

In conclusion, the passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, but it does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population.

I previously answered this question as (B) It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage is actually expressing a negative view towards the idea of learning the lessons of history. The passage states that it is ""nearly impossible to discover its lessons,"" which suggests that the argument is directed towards discrediting the idea that we can easily learn from the past. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that learning the lessons of history is not a straightforward task, as the situation that led to World War I is unlikely to occur again. Therefore, the lessons of history may not be directly applicable to future situations. This view is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and denying it at the same time, as one can acknowledge the importance of learning from the past while also recognizing the limitations of doing so.

However, the passage also implies that the idea of learning the lessons of history is not taken seriously, as it is ""nearly impossible to discover its lessons.""

Question: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B - A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.

Reasoning:
I initially chose option B because I thought it was the most relevant principle to the argument presented in the passage. The author argues that despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were found to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. This suggests that the theory has withstood serious attempts to disprove it, which aligns with the principle of option B.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that option C is the correct answer. The passage states that the consequences of quantum theory are not considered counterintuitive because the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate. This implies that the theory's predictions are not necessarily intuitive, but they have been proven to be accurate through experimentation. Option C best reflects this idea.

Correct Answer: C - The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.

Explanation:
The correct answer is option C, which states that the consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate. This principle is the most relevant to the argument presented in the passage, as it highlights the importance of experimental evidence in supporting a scientific theory. While option B also considers the idea of a theory being subjected to serious attempts to disprove it, option C specifically addresses the issue of counterintuitive consequences and their relationship to experimental evidence.",,,B,0,581,387,968,

* Distorting the opponent's argument and attacking the distorted version is not a valid way to refute an argument.
* The argument should be addressed directly, rather than through manipulation or misrepresentation.

The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because it assumes that if the press has the right to publish a nonlibelous story about a private individual, then it has an obligation to do so. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. The press has the right to publish information of interest to the public, but it does not necessarily have an obligation to pry into the personal lives of private individuals.

The correct answer is (B) One's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. The argument assumes that if the press has the right to publish a nonlibelous story about a private individual, then it has an obligation to do so. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as the press has the right to publish information of interest to the public but does not necessarily have an obligation to pry into the personal lives of private individuals.

The argument should provide more justification for why the press has an obligation to publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals beyond simply asserting that such information is of interest to the public. The argument should consider the privacy rights of private individuals and the limits of free speech in a society that values individual privacy and dignity.

Reflection:
After reevaluating the given information, I believe the correct answer is (B) The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.

Initial Answer:
I initially answered (D) Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this principle does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.

Reasoning:
The Figorian Wildlife Commission is advocating for regulation to protect endangered species and their habitats, which is a fundamental right of future generations. The Figorian Development Commission, on the other hand, is prioritizing economic growth and development, which could lead to further environmental damage.

Principle (B) recognizes the importance of preserving wildlife and habitats for future generations, which aligns with the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position. It emphasizes that the needs of future generations should take precedence over the economic interests of individual nations.

In contrast, Principle (D) focuses on preventing further environmental damage, but it does not explicitly address the need to preserve wildlife and habitats for future generations. While it is important to prevent environmental damage, this principle does not directly support the Figorian Development Commission's position in this context.

Principles (A), (C), and (E) do not directly relate to the issue at hand and are therefore not the best options to support the Figorian Development Commission's position.

In conclusion, the best principle to support the Figorian Development Commission's position is (B) The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.

Both arguments involve a situation where a particular course of action is not recommended because it would have unintended consequences. In option C, the argument is that limiting purchases to what one truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income would lead to a severe recession, making it impossible for most people to save or invest. Similarly, in the argument above, the recommendation not to adopt a healthier diet based on fish protein is because it would lead to the extinction of most marine species.

However, I realize now that I made a mistake in my analysis of option C. I should have considered the potential consequences of not adopting the healthier diet based on fish protein. While it is true that the extinction of marine species would be a negative consequence, it is also important to consider the potential health benefits of such a diet. By adopting a diet based on fish protein, people could potentially reduce their risk of heart disease and other health problems.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C. The reasoning in this argument most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument above.",,,C,0,791,311,1102,

","  Reflection:

Upon further reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (B) Even if only some of the thread and rope that is currently being made from nylon were instead made from cotton fiber, some environmental damage would be avoided.

Explanation:
The argument states that the process of manufacturing nylon releases harmful gases into the environment, and that using cotton fiber instead of nylon would reduce environmental damage. However, the argument does not address the quantity of nylon manufactured annually. Therefore, option (D) If the quantity of nylon manufactured annually decreased substantially, the volume of several pollutants that are released into the environment during its manufacture would be reduced is not relevant to the argument.

Option (A) Even if the quantity of nitrous oxide released into the environment decreased, many environmental problems would remain unsolved is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument is focused on the specific issue of nitrous oxide emissions from nylon manufacturing, rather than addressing broader environmental problems.

Option (C) If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products is also not relevant, as the argument is focused on the substitution of cotton fiber for nylon in the production of thread and rope, rather than the overall use of nylon in other products.

Option (E) If thread and rope continue to be made from nylon, the production of cotton fiber will not increase as rapidly as it would if all thread and rope were to be made from cotton fiber is also not relevant, as the argument is focused on the substitution of cotton fiber for nylon in the production of thread and rope, rather than the overall production of cotton fiber.

Explanation:
The journalist's argument is based on the assumption that Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, which implies that it is not a member of the trade group. However, the journalist does not provide any evidence to support this assumption. In fact, the representative of the trade group confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group, including Bruch Industries. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known.

Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?

Reflection:

Initial Answer: B - Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.

Reasoning: The curator mentions that the hippopotamus resembles a child's roy, but then argues that it was a religious object. This suggests that the curator is assuming that earthenware figures were not used as children's toys in ancient Egypt.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this assumption is not necessarily true. While it is possible that earthenware figures were not used as children's toys, it is also possible that they were used in other contexts, such as religious rituals or ceremonies. Therefore, this assumption is not necessarily required by the curator's argument.

Correct Answer: E - The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.

Explanation: The curator's argument hinges on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was intended to be a religious object rather than a children's toy.

Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a logical fallacy in my reasoning. I mistakenly assumed that the argument was based on a causal relationship between the variables, when in fact, it was based on a correlation.

To correctly identify the argument that is most similar to the one in the prompt, I will analyze each option carefully:

A) During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.

This argument is similar to the original argument in that it suggests a causal relationship between two variables. However, it is flawed because it assumes that an increase in gas prices directly causes an increase in consumer complaints, without considering other potential factors that may influence consumer complaints.

B) The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.

This argument is similar to the original argument in that it suggests a correlation between two variables. However, it is flawed because it assumes that the presence of migratory birds directly causes the number of birds remaining in the region during the winter, without considering other potential factors that may influence the number of birds remaining.

C) It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.

This argument is similar to the original argument in that it suggests a correlation between two variables. However, it is flawed because it assumes that the type of car a driver owns directly causes the likelihood of receiving a speeding ticket, without considering other potential factors that may influence the likelihood of receiving a speeding ticket.

D) Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.

This argument is similar to the original argument in that it suggests a correlation between two variables. However, it is flawed because it assumes that the type of photography a photographer specializes in directly causes their level of interest in other types of photography, without considering other potential factors that may influence a photographer's level of interest.

E) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.

This argument is similar to the original argument in that it suggests a correlation between two variables. However, it is flawed because it assumes that the type of service a company provides directly causes the number of workers they hire, without considering other potential factors that may influence the number of workers they hire.

Based on my reflection, the argument that is most similar to the one in the prompt is option B. Both arguments suggest a correlation between two variables without considering other potential factors that may influence the relationship between the variables. Therefore, option B is the best answer.",,,E,0,647,736,1383,

Choices:
  A: Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.
  B: Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.
  C: Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win.
  D: Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful.
  E: Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and non-ornamental plants are weeds.

Question: The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following?

Reflection:
After reevaluating the argument, I realize that the structure of the reasoning is most parallel to option B: Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.

The argument in the passage is similar to the one in option B in that both involve a comparison between two different scenarios:

* In option B, the comparison is between short and long-distance races, and the argument is that bicyclists with only average speed can win long-distance races if they have better-built bicycles and better endurance than average.
* In the passage, the comparison is between retailers who excel in convenience and those who excel in variety of merchandise, and the argument is that a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas.

Both arguments use the same structure, with a contrast between two scenarios, followed by a conclusion that the second scenario is possible even if the first scenario is not. Therefore, the answer is option B.",,,A,0,790,301,1091,

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I have reflected on my mistake. Here is my self-reflection:

I misunderstood the role of the statement in the argument. I thought it was the main conclusion of the argument, when in fact it is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion. The statement is used to support a premise for the argument's main conclusion, which is that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised.

Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that the correct answer is (B) In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.

Explanation:
The argument that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery is strengthened if it can be shown that lawmakers generally assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. This means that lawmakers are not simply imposing penalties for theft and bribery without considering the level of harm caused by each crime. Rather, they are taking into account the severity of the harm caused by each crime when determining the appropriate penalty.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. This answer choice best supports the argument that lawmakers in these jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.",,,A,0,616,284,900,
