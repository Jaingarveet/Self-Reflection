Passage 1: Lincoln argues that the Union can exist divided into Free and Slave States if each State respects the sovereignty of others. He criticizes Lincoln's statement that the Union, as it is, violates the law of God.
Passage 2: Lincoln clarifies his ""house divided against itself"" metaphor, arguing that slavery, not state variety, is the source of quarrels and difficulties.
The central tension is that Douglas criticizes Lincoln for misrepresenting the Constitution and Lincoln's response clarifies his position, explaining that slavery, not state variety, is the divisive issue.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't describe Volkov's work as having involved analysis of data from earlier studies on the plant's response to electricity. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov based his work on Hodick and Sievers's earlier model, this was the sole model that Volkov relied on, and there is no suggestion that he made use of multiple ""published theories"" or ""earlier models""; moreover, he made more extensive use of data generated by his own experiment than of Hodick and Sievers's model.",C,C,1,1169,54,1223,

  C: A large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap.
  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","Thought: 
The correct answer is A: If the total calcium ion concentration is above the trap's threshold, the Venus flytrap will close.

Hodick and Sievers's model predicts that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a single hair stimulation does not reach this level. Therefore, if the total concentration exceeds the threshold with only one hair stimulated, the trap will close, and the model's prediction will not hold.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $B$ is the best answer. The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",A,B,0,1202,100,1302,

The passage states that the insular cortex of the brain, which processes emotions, is activated when CT fibers are stimulated by gentle touch. This suggests that the emotional aspect of touch is experienced when CT fibers respond to a stimulus.

According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch.

","Thought: 
Passage 1 describes Tocqueville's view that distinct employment should be given to the various faculties of men and women, dividing their duties based on their physical and moral constitutions.
Passage 2, attributed to Mill, suggests that each individual's capacities should be proven through trial, allowing them to find their proper sphere in society based on their abilities and choices.

Thus, the correct answer is A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",A,A,1,1284,128,1412,

She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family's ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't.

","Thought: The passage states that the findings about the formation of ibises likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese. It implies that these birds also create a similar wake and experience similar energy savings when flying in a V formation.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. At the beginning of the fifth paragraph the passage states that ""the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult."" In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication.

  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.
","Thought: 
The correct answer is B: ""It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.""
Passage 2 states that ""All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread [slavery] into new territory."" This directly supports choice B.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery.

","Choices:
  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","Thought: The requirement for multiple triggers before the Venus flytrap closes ensures that it only expends energy when it is sure prey is present, thus conserving its energy for worthwhile meals.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1138,43,1181,

The first paragraph describes the cultural tradition of using a go-between for marriage proposals and how this was not followed by Akira, who proposed directly to Chie and Naomi's family.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals.

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","Thought: 
Passage 1: Beveridge views liberty as a justification for US conquest and imperialism, seeing the US as a ""sentinel"" and a ""greater England with a nobler destiny."" He believes the US has a mission to propagate its ideals and institutions.

Passage 2: Bryan, on the other hand, argues that pursuing imperialism and colonizing the Philippines would undermine liberty at home and create ""perpetual hatred"" from the subject peoples. He sees liberty as a universal ideal, present in the hearts of all people, and warns against foreign domination.

Thus, the central difference is that Beveridge sees liberty as a justification for expansionism, while Bryan warns that expansion will corrupt the very liberty it claims to spread.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",B,B,1,1276,160,1436,
