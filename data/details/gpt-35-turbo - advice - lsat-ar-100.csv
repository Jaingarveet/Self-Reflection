Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 2, 4, or 6.
If a certain pair of days features the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy, then neither of those breeds can be featured on the intervening days.
Therefore, we need to look for pairs of days that are two days apart and that include at least one of days 2, 4, or 6.

We know that Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday. 
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports. 
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

  A: zero

","Thought:
To determine the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece, we need to consider the given conditions and constraints. 
From the given conditions, we know that the third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. 
Also, no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. 
Therefore, Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first or second solo. 
If Wayne performs a modern piece in the first solo, then he must perform a traditional piece in the third or fourth solo. 
If Wayne performs a modern piece in the second solo, then he must perform a traditional piece in the third, fourth, or fifth solo. 
Thus, Wayne must perform a traditional piece in at least two solos.

B: H is sixth.
If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, R, S) and the fourth article must be Y. Since S must be earlier than Y, S must be fourth and Q and R must be fifth and sixth (in some order). Then, the finance articles (G, H, J) must be edited last, in the order J, G, H. This choice fully determines the order of the articles.
C: R is fourth.
If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, S, [REDACTED]). We cannot determine the fourth article, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.
D: R is seventh.

- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
We need to find a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
From the last condition, we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there must be at least two sales representatives in Zone 3.

Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1, so at most one of them is in Zone 1.

To determine the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships, we need to first identify which candidates are assigned to which countries based on the given constraints. 
If Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. 
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. 
Using these constraints, we can eliminate impossible combinations and identify the remaining possible combinations of variables. 
If Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Novetzke is not assigned to any ambassadorship. If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela. If Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, then Kayne is assigned to Venezuela. If neither Kayne nor Novetzke is assigned to any ambassadorship, then Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela and Kayne is assigned to Yemen.

  C: fourth or sixth
  D: fourth or seventh
  E: sixth or seventh
","Thought:
If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either immediately before R or immediately after R. 
If F is performed immediately before R, then at least two compositions are performed after F and before R. 
Therefore, F cannot be performed first or second. 
If F is performed immediately after R, then at least two compositions are performed after R and before F. 
Therefore, F cannot be performed sixth or seventh. 
Thus, F must be performed either fourth or seventh.

  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L
  C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H

  E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H
","Thought:
The order of the compositions must satisfy the following conditions:
- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
- O is performed either first or fifth.
- The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
- P is performed at some time before S.
- At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
From the given choices, we need to find an order that satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
Option A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H
- O is performed fifth, which satisfies one of the given conditions.
- The eighth composition performed is either L or H, which is not satisfied.
- P is performed before S, which satisfies one of the given conditions.
- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, which is not satisfied.
- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, which is not satisfied.
This option does not satisfy all the given conditions and constraints.
Option B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L
- O is performed first, which satisfies one of the given conditions.
- The eighth composition performed is either L or H, which is satisfied.
- P is performed before S, which satisfies one of the given conditions.
- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, which is satisfied.
- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, which is satisfied.
This option satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.
