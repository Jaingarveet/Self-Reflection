  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Thought: The correct answer is C.

Proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to employing Western scientific methods to study a nonscientific culture. This is because they argue that using Western scientific methods and perspectives to understand other cultures is distorting and reflects Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

While choices A, B, D, and E involve various forms of cultural study and comparison, only choice C imposes Western scientific methods on a nonscientific culture, directly conflicting with the proponents' perspective.

  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

","Thought: The correct answer choice undermines the idea that larger firms with specialized workers are inherently more productive, which is a key link in the argument for the connection between size and market power.

Choice A does not weaken the connection as it still acknowledges that larger businesses can exert monopoly power, even if this power is limited to a specific region. Choice B is irrelevant to the connection as it focuses on salary rather than market power. Choice C strengthens the connection by suggesting that domination by a few players leads to collusion and higher prices, which is indicative of monopoly power. Choice D does not affect the connection as the varying size of businesses does not change the fact that increased size can lead to monopoly power in certain industries.

Choice E is the correct answer as it refutes the notion that increased specialization of workers leads to higher productivity, which is a key assumption in the argument for the connection between firm size and market power.

  E: Marshall's colleagues at the NAACP subsequently revised his methods and extended their applications to areas of law and politics beyond those for which they were designed.

The passage states that Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants and tried out different approaches to see which worked best. This directly supports the statement that he declined cases with plaintiffs who might make an unfavorable impression on the public. 

The other choices are not directly supported by the passage. While choice C mentions a 'radical departure from accepted conventions', it is not attributed to any conflict within the NAACP or opposition from its members. Choice D is incorrect as there is no comparison made between lower and higher court judges in the passage. Choice E is also incorrect as there is no mention of Marshall's colleagues revising his methods. Finally, choice A is not supported as there is no indication that Marshall's ideological motivations changed during his time on the Supreme Court; the focus is on his technical innovations with the NAACP.

","Thought: The passage discusses the use of proverbs within the Mexican American community and their significance. It emphasizes how proverbs are used to convey wisdom, teach values, and strengthen cultural ties. 

The key characteristics of proverbs are that they are self-contained sayings that can be understood independently of their specific context, and they carry messages or pieces of wisdom. The unique aspect highlighted in the passage is the use of proverbs within a specific cultural and social context, particularly their role in fostering a consciousness of ethnicity and transmitting cultural heritage. 

Choice B directly aligns with this unique aspect, suggesting that the use of proverbs within a community serves to convey a sense of ethnicity and cultural identity to its members, especially the children who are being taught and shaped by these proverbs.

","Thought: 
The passage presents a discussion about the ethical obligations of defense lawyers and their relationship with their clients, the court, and society. It outlines two opposing viewpoints: one arguing that lawyers should provide the best defense without judging their clients, and the other suggesting that lawyers have a duty to the court and society, and should not present assertions they know to be false.

Lines 7-11 present the viewpoint that lawyers should not act as mere mouthpieces but as advocates, without expressing personal opinions. This is countered in lines 28-31, which state that lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces but advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case. While there is a shared perspective on the role of lawyers as advocates, the latter part introduces a nuanced perspective that advocates for a balanced approach, considering the lawyer's duty to the court and society.

Therefore, the correct answer choice reflects the relationship between these two parts of the passage.

Reflection: My previous incorrect answer choice focused on the similarity of phrases (""mere mouthpieces"") without fully considering the context and relationship of the ideas presented. I should have paid closer attention to the nuances of the arguments and how they built on or countered each other.

The author highlights the assumption made by scientists that alcoholic beverages only contain alcohol as an active ingredient and critiques this by presenting evidence that wine, specifically, has unique health benefits. The passage mentions that studies show wine consumption is linked to a reduction in premature heart disease and that this effect is likely due to certain compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic drinks.
