- I recall previously answering this question incorrectly.
- I reviewed the advice provided, particularly the emphasis on patient safety and medication use during pregnancy.
- I121 is radioactive and therefore not safe for use during pregnancy.
- Propylthiouracil is generally considered the safer option compared to Methimazole during pregnancy.
- Carbimazole is converted to Methimazole in the body, raising similar concerns for use in pregnancy.

All antithyroid drugs can cross placenta so risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitre is always there. Both carbimazole and propylthiouracil can be used during pregnancy, but propylthiouracil is the drug of choice because its greater protein binding allows low doses of propylthiouracil to be transferred across the placenta and therefore less chance of hypothyroidism. 
The lowest effective dose of propylthiouracil should be given and it is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester since TSH Receptor antibodies tend to decline in pregnancy.

","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country.2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role.3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat. Appointment of medical officers at state headquarters in order to make their monitoring role more effective;5.

**Self-Reflection:**
* **Problem:** I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting ""A: Pka is equal to Ph"" as the answer.
* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the answer choices and select the one that best explains why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.
* **Correct Answer:** ""C: Weak acid and weak base combination"" is the correct answer. Bicarbonate buffers are ideal because they consist of a weak acid (carbonic acid) and a weak base (bicarbonate ion), which allows them to effectively buffer against both acidic and alkaline changes in the blood.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer(""C"")","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U.

Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

","I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. After reflecting on my mistake, I understand that I need to focus on the specific context of the question, which is the surgical procedure ""cyst-gastrostomy"" and its complications. 
Here's my thought process for this question:
1. **Cyst-gastrostomy**: This is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.
2. **Pseudo pancreatic cyst**: This is a collection of fluid near the pancreas that is not a true cyst.
3. **Major complication**: This refers to a serious problem that can occur after surgery.
Based on this information, I can eliminate choices A, B, and D:
* **Infection**: While infection is a possible complication of any surgery, it is not specific to cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts.
* **Obstruction**: This is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy.
* **Hemorrhage**: This is a rare complication of cyst-gastrostomy.
Therefore, the most likely major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is:
**C: Fistula**
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and another organ, such as the colon or the small intestine. This can lead to serious complications, such as infection and malnutrition.

Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
","Choices:
  A: Vagus nerve
  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
  C: SLN nerve
  D: RLN nerve
","## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**Previous Answer:** C: SLN nerve
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly identified the SLN nerve as the most likely injured nerve based on the patient's symptoms of recurrent aspirations. However, this was a mistake because the SLN nerve is responsible for sensation in the skin of the neck and shoulder, not swallowing function.
**Correct Answer:** B: Glossopharyngeal nerve
**Reasoning:** The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for swallowing function and sensory information from the posterior third of the tongue. Damage to this nerve can lead to recurrent aspirations, which aligns with the patient's symptoms. The absence of voice changes further supports this conclusion, as the vagus nerve, which controls the voice, is likely intact.
**Key Learnings:**
* Carefully consider all potential nerves involved in the affected area and their specific functions.
* Don't jump to conclusions based on limited information.
* Thoroughly analyze the patient's symptoms and their correlation with the function of each nerve.
## Applying Learnings to Current Question:
**Thought Process:**
1. The patient's recurrent aspirations point to a swallowing dysfunction.
2. The nerves involved in swallowing are the vagus, glossopharyngeal, and hypoglossal nerves.
3. The absence of voice changes suggests the vagus nerve is likely intact.
4. The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for swallowing function in the posterior tongue, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the symptoms and the potential causes to identify the correct answer.
* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is **D: Strychnous nux vomica**.
**Answer:**
Action: Answer(""D"")","STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.
