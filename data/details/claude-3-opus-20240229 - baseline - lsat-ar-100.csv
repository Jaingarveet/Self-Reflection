  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This is a fixed condition.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This is also a fixed condition.
3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday can have one or two witnesses.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday. This eliminates some possibilities.
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This further constrains the possibilities.
Now, let's look at each choice:
A: This is possible. If Franco testifies on Monday, Garcia could testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
B: This is not possible. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who would have to be on Wednesday in this scenario.
C: This is possible. If Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday, the other conditions can still be met.
D: This is possible. If Garcia testifies on Monday and Hong on Wednesday, the other conditions are met.
E: This is possible. If Jackson is one of the two witnesses on Tuesday, Monday could have two witnesses and the other conditions are met.

  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least three spaces between the restaurants.
2. With seven spaces in total, this constraint effectively limits the possible locations of the restaurants to the ends of the row (spaces 1 and 7), or to spaces 2 and 6.
3. Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:
   A: This would restrict a restaurant to the middle three spaces, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.
   
   B: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.
   
   C: This is equivalent to the original constraint. If either the toy store or the veterinarian is between the restaurants, then there must be at least two businesses separating the restaurants.
   
   D: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.
   
   E: This is unrelated to the separation of the restaurants.

3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is in #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the remaining one of those two.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. The remaining spaces are #4, #5, and #6. Souza could be in #4 or #5, and Xu would be in a higher number.
5. The only definite assignment we can make based on the given information is that Xu must be in parking space #6. This is because Xu must be higher than Souza, and #6 is the only remaining higher space than both #4 and #5 where Souza could be.

3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the fourth solo is traditional, then the second and third must also be traditional (to satisfy the condition of two consecutive traditional pieces). But this would violate the condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
   Therefore, the fourth solo must be a modern piece performed by Zara.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect which solos are traditional.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that the first traditional piece can't be the first or second solo.

3. O must be performed either first or fifth according to the conditions. Since T is already occupying the fifth position, O must be performed first.

4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 2, next to the pharmacy.
5. This means the optometrist, one of the restaurants, and the toy store must occupy spaces 3, 5, and 6 (not necessarily in that order).
6. The shoe store in space 4 must be next to two of these: the optometrist, a restaurant, or the toy store.
Looking at the choices:
A: Not necessarily true. The optometrist could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to a restaurant.
B: This must be true. As deduced in step 4, the pharmacy in space 1 must be next to the veterinarian in space 2.
C: Not necessarily true. A restaurant could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to the toy store.
D: Not necessarily true. The toy store could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to the shoe store.
E: Not necessarily true. The veterinarian must be in space 2, not next to the shoe store.

4. So if Ong is in Venezuela and Jaramillo is assigned, the other ambassador must be Kayne, not Landon.

  B: J is first.
  C: Q is second.
  D: S is fifth
  E: Y is sixth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that G is fourth. This means J must be first, second, or third (since J must be earlier than G).
2. If J is first, then H cannot be second (consecutive articles can't cover the same topic). So Q, R, S, or Y must be second. But R must be after G, and S must be before Y. This leaves only Q for the second position. But then the third position must be S (since S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third). This fills the first five positions: J, Q, S, G, H. The last two must be Y and R in that order. So in this case, H is fifth and Y is sixth.
3. If J is second, then the first position must be Q, S, or Y. It can't be S (because S must be earlier than Y). So it's either Q or Y. If it's Q, then S must be third (the condition for S being earlier than Q). This fills the first five positions: Q, J, S, G, H. The last two must be Y and R in that order. So again, H is fifth and Y is sixth. If the first position is Y, then the third position must be Q or S. But it can't be S (S must be earlier than Y). So it's Q. This fills the first five positions: Y, J, Q, G, H. The last two must be S and R in that order. Again, H is fifth.
4. If J is third, then the first two positions must be some combination of Q, S, and Y. We know S must be earlier than Y, so the possibilities are Q-S, S-Q, or S-Y. If it's Q-S or S-Q, then the first five positions are filled: Q/S, S/Q, J, G, H. The last two must be Y and R in that order. Once more, H is fifth and Y is sixth. If it's S-Y, then the fourth position is G, the fifth must be Q or H, and the sixth and seventh must be H/Q and R in some order. In this case, H could be sixth, but Y cannot be sixth.

3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that if the third and fourth solos are traditional, then Wayne must perform the fourth solo.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This is a key condition. It means that Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo.
6. If Wayne performs a modern piece in the first solo, he could then perform traditional pieces in the third and fourth solos, satisfying all conditions. In this case, he would perform two traditional pieces.
7. If Wayne performs a modern piece in the second solo, he could then perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo, satisfying all conditions. In this case, he would perform one traditional piece.

3. Exactly two students review the same play(s). If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, that would make three students (Kramer, O'Neill, Megregian) reviewing the same play, which violates the condition.

7. This leaves G and K. K must be on the middle shelf with I, as it's on a higher shelf than F and M.
8. G is the only book left and must go on the bottom shelf.

  B: Wayne performs the third solo.
  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.
  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.
  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that the third solo is a traditional piece.
2. We also know that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
3. If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then the second solo cannot be traditional. This is because no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.
4. Therefore, if the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist, they must both be modern pieces. This means that the third and fourth solos must be the two consecutive traditional pieces.
5. We are told that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since we've determined that the fourth solo must be traditional, it must be performed by Wayne.
6. Since the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, and we know that the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist, the fifth solo must be performed by the other pianist.
7. We can conclude that if the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then Zara must perform the fifth solo.

","Let's go through the conditions one by one:
1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. This eliminates choice D, as it has two batches of oatmeal cookies made on Monday.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. All remaining choices satisfy this condition.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This eliminates choice A, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies (Wednesday) is not made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies (Wednesday).

1. We know that none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Since none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must also be 1 day. Choice A is true.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
4. If Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, then its website target must also be 1 day. But then Truvest's website target would have to be 2 or 3 days, which is not possible because its voicemail target can't be 3 days. 
5. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days. Choice C is true.
6. Consequently, Solide's website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. Choice B could be false.

1. S is performed fourth, so we need to figure out the possible compositions for the first, second, and third positions.
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since S is fourth, O must be first in this case.
3. P must be performed before S. So P could be second or third.
4. T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means that if T is second, F must be third; if T is third, R must be second.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that Y (wildlife) is fourth. This means the articles in positions 3 and 5 cannot be about wildlife.
2. S must be earlier than Y. So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. If S is in position 3, then Q cannot be third (as per the condition). So if S is third, Q must be first or second.
4. If S is in position 1 or 2, then Q can be in position 3.
5. J (finance) must be earlier than G (finance), and G must be earlier than R (nutrition). So the order of these three articles must be J, G, R.
6. If Q is third, then S must be first or second (as per condition 2). In this case, J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7 in that order.
7. If Q is first, then S can be second or third. But if S is third, then J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.

  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be featured on days 2, 7 (due to the consecutive day rule), or day 6 (because then they would be featured on two consecutive days, 6 and 7).
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or 7. So they must be featured on three of the days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on the same day as Himalayans, or on day 7.
Now, let's look at each choice:
A: If Greyhounds were featured on days 3 and 5, this would violate the rule that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. So this can't be true.
B: Newfoundlands could be featured on day 3, as there are no rules against this. This could be true.
C: If Rottweilers were featured on day 6, this would mean Himalayans couldn't be featured on day 6. This is possible given the constraints. This could be true.
D: If Rottweilers were featured only on day 3, this would mean Himalayans couldn't be featured on day 3. This is possible given the constraints. This could be true.
E: If Rottweilers were featured on exactly three days, they would have to be featured on days 2, 4, and 6 (given the other constraints). But this would mean Himalayans couldn't be featured on days 2, 4, or 6, and since they can't be featured on days 1 or 7 either, there wouldn't be enough days for them to be featured on exactly three days.

5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Choice A: P cannot be performed second.
- If O is first, P could be second, followed by compositions between O and S.
- If O is fifth, P could be second, as it's before S.
Choice B: P cannot be performed third.
- Similar to Choice A, P could be third in both cases of O's position.
Choice C: P cannot be performed fourth.
- If O is first, P could be fourth, with two compositions between O and S.
- If O is fifth, P could be fourth, as it's before S.
Choice D: P cannot be performed sixth.
- If O is first, P could be sixth, with S being seventh or eighth.
- However, if O is fifth, P cannot be sixth. There must be at least one composition between O and S, and the eighth must be L or H. If P is sixth and S seventh, there's no room for a composition between O and S.
Choice E: P cannot be performed seventh.
- If O is first, P could be seventh, with S being eighth.

1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so a kitten breed must be featured on day 2.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. So they must be featured on three of days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
3. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. This means Himalayans can't be featured on any two consecutive days.
4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. This doesn't directly affect the kitten breeds.
5. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. This means the kitten breed featured on day 1 (if any) can't be featured on day 7.
Looking at the choices:
A: This violates rule 3 as Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 4 and 5).
B: This also violates rule 3 as Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 5 and 6).
C: This satisfies all the rules. Himalayans are featured on three non-consecutive days (2, 4, 6), and no breed is repeated on consecutive days.

3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. However, Kayne could still be assigned to Zambia in this scenario.
4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. So choice D (Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship) can be true.
5. The question doesn't provide any information that would prevent Ong from being assigned an ambassadorship, so choice E can also be true.
6. If Novetzke is assigned to Zambia (choice C), then Kayne cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship due to constraint 1. This scenario is possible given the constraints.
7. However, if Kayne is assigned to Zambia (choice B), then Jaramillo must also be assigned due to constraint 2. But Jaramillo cannot also be assigned to Zambia, and the other two countries would need to be filled by the remaining candidates.

3. Now, the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We have a chemist (M) and two zoologists (P and R). So we still need at least one botanist.
4. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. But we already have two zoologists (P and R), so we can't have more than one botanist.

   A. This is false. As deduced in (5), Megregian must review Undulation.
   B. This is true. As deduced in (2), O'Neill only reviews Tamerlane, not Undulation.
   C. This is true. As deduced in (5), Jiang must review Undulation.
   D. This could be true. Nothing prevents Lopez from also reviewing Tamerlane in addition to Undulation.
   E. This is false. As deduced in (2), O'Neill only reviews Tamerlane, not Sunset.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This means they can't only review Sunset.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviews Sunset, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Sunset.
3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means Megregian must review at least two plays.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This means there must be a pair that reviews the same set of plays.
Now let's look at the answer choices:
A. Lopez - This could be possible, as we don't have any information that contradicts Lopez only reviewing Sunset.
B. O'Neill - This is not possible, as we know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.
C. Jiang, Lopez - This is not possible, as we know Lopez cannot review any play Jiang reviews.
D. Kramer, O'Neill - This is not possible, as we know they both review Tamerlane.

  D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, which in turn has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So the order of these three, from lowest to highest bay number, is: textiles, livestock, grain.
2. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So fuel comes before produce.
3. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Given the information from point 1, this means that the order of these four, from lowest to highest bay number, must be: fuel, produce, textiles, livestock.
4. The only cargo type not yet placed is machinery. It cannot go between produce and textiles (as they are next to each other), nor can it go between textiles and livestock (for the same reason).
5. This leaves three possible positions for machinery: before fuel, between fuel and produce, or after livestock.
6. If machinery is before fuel, then fuel would be next to produce, contradicting the statement that textiles is next to produce.
7. If machinery is between fuel and produce, then fuel would be next to machinery. This scenario is described in choice A, so choice A could be true.
8. If machinery is after livestock, then grain would be next to machinery. This scenario is described in choice B, so choice B could be true.
9. Choice C states that livestock is next to fuel, but we know from the order established in point 3 that produce and textiles are between fuel and livestock, so this must be false.
10. Choice D states that produce is next to livestock, but we know textiles is between them, so this must be false.
11. Choice E states that textiles is next to fuel, but we know produce is between them, so this must be false.

1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
5. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4
   - Souza: no specific limitation
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #1, #2, or #3
6. Counting the employees with specific limitations:
   - Togowa is limited to two possible spaces (#1 or #2)
   - Young is limited to three possible spaces (#1, #2, or #3)
   - Robertson is limited to four possible spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4)

   - Nina could give her report on Monday or Wednesday
   - Robert could give his report on Monday or Wednesday morning
5. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. But this is impossible because George must give his report on Tuesday.

  B: one French novel and one Russian play
  C: one Russian novel and one French play

  E: two Russian novels
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The organizer must select at least 5 works total.
2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. This means at least 1 Russian work must be selected.
3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. This leaves room for 1-2 plays.
4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. 
5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. But we know at least 1 Russian work must be selected (from point 2).
6. So if both French plays are selected, the Russian work must be a novel. This would mean selecting 2 French plays, 1 Russian novel, and at least 2 French novels to have at least as many French novels as Russian (point 4).
7. But this totals 5 works, with 4 being French (2 plays, 2 novels). This hits the maximum number of French works (point 2).
8. In this scenario, the organizer has selected 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, and 2 French plays, meeting the ""at least"" requirement for answer choice A.
9. No other answer choice is necessarily true in all valid scenarios.

Given:
- I is on the middle shelf.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- K is on a higher shelf than F.
- O is on a higher shelf than L.
- F and M are on the same shelf.

- I and M are on the middle shelf.
- F must also be on the middle shelf (same as M).
- K must be on the top shelf (higher than F).
- O must be on the top or middle shelf (higher than L).
This leaves G, H, and L, which could be arranged in multiple ways on the bottom shelf. Not fully determined.
Choice B: K and G are on the same shelf.
- K and G could be on the top or middle shelf.
- F and M could be on the bottom or middle shelf.
- O and L could be on any shelf depending on the placement of K and G.
Not fully determined.
Choice C: L and F are on the same shelf (bottom).
- L and F are on the bottom shelf.
- M is also on the bottom shelf (same as F).
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than F).
- O must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than L).
With 3 books on the bottom shelf, 2 or 3 must be on the middle, and 0 to 2 on the top. The exact placement of G, H, K, and O is not fully determined.
Choice D: M and H are on the same shelf (bottom).
- M, H, and F are on the bottom shelf.
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than F).
- O must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than L).
Similar to Choice C, the exact placement of G, K, L, and O is not fully determined.
Choice E: H and O are on the same shelf (top).
- H and O are on the top shelf.
- L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (lower than O).
- I is on the middle shelf.
- K must be on the top or middle shelf (higher than F).
- F and M must be on the bottom shelf (lower than K, and to have more books on bottom than top).

3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means Solide could have the 1-day or 2-day website target, while Truvest must have either the 2-day or 3-day website target.
