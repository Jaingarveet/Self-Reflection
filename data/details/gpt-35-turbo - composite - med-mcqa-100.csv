Based on the patient's symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction and discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged, and the biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that affects the respiratory tract, kidneys, and other organs. It presents with upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, discharge, and crusting.","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness.

It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country.2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role.3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level.4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat.

Explanation: 
Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by fear or anxiety about situations where escape may be difficult or help may not be available in case of a panic attack or other distressing symptoms. Fear of crowds, option [B], matches the description of agoraphobia.","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fear of crowded Agoraphobia* This is an example of irrational fear of situations. It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice.* It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from familiar setting of home and patient believes that he cannot escape from these places, to a safer place (usually home). This fear results in avoidance of these places which include public places, stores, crowd, travelling alone in bus, train or plane, Theaters, Tunnels, Bridge, standing in line small enclosed rooms or lifts.* The patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be perceived to be difficult if he suddenly develops embarrassing or incapaciating symptoms. These embarrassing or incapaciating symptoms are the classical symptoms of panic. A full-blown panic attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms (like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder).Other options* Fear of strangers- Xenophobia* Fear of death- Thanatophobia* Fear of fire- Pyrophobia",B,B,1,592,67,659,
