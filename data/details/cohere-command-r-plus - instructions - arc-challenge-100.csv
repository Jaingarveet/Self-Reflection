When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?
Choices:
  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.
  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.
  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.
  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.
","Choices:
  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.
  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.
  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.
  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.
","Thought: 
When the car is on the inclined track, the force of gravity has two components: one parallel to the surface, which accelerates the car downwards, and one perpendicular, which 'holds' the car to the surface. When the car reaches the flat surface, only the perpendicular component of gravity remains, acting as a force pushing the car towards the surface. This force is balanced by the normal force exerted by the surface, resulting in no net force acting on the car. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. Therefore, when the forces on the car are balanced, there is no acceleration, and the car's speed decreases.

Answer: D. The forces influencing the car are balanced.

","Thought: 
Inherited traits are characteristics that are passed down from one generation to the next through genetic information.

The correct answer, ""B: change in leaf color during the autumn season,"" is an inherited trait controlled by genetics. While environmental factors can influence leaf color to some extent, the underlying ability of a tree to produce specific pigments in response to seasonal changes is genetically determined. This trait is consistently expressed in the offspring of buckeye trees, making it an inherited trait.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought: 
Prior to the introduction of a predator, the sheep population on Hirta experienced an increase in light-wool sheep over the last two decades, indicating their advantage in the environment. Typically, size and strength offer survival and breeding benefits. However, in this case, the absence of predators and ample food resources favor the lighter, smaller sheep for unknown reasons.

Upon the introduction of a predator, the dynamic shifts. Overall, sheep become more vulnerable, and their population will initially decrease. Specifically, the light-wool sheep, being the current dominant type, will be more exposed and susceptible, leading to a reduction in their numbers. This initial decrease in light-wool sheep is the reverse of the trend observed in the predator-free environment.
