  D: (13x+1)/24
  E: (13x-12)/24
","Thought: 
Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total length of the fence in inches is (1/2)x + 6(x-1) = 13x/2 - 6. 
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we need to divide the total length in inches by 12 to convert it to feet. 
So, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2 - 6)/12 = (13x - 24)/24.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1/2
length of pickets = 1/2x
If there are x pickets, it implies that there are x -1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1/2 x + 6(x-1) in inches
total length in feet =( 1/2 x + 6(x-1))/12
Simplify to get (13X-12)/24

The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m.

The ages are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months or 0.25 years. The youngest member is 7 years old. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years. 
In an A.P., the sum of all terms (S) can be calculated using the formula S = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms (members in this case), a is the first term (age of the youngest member), and d is the common difference.
We can substitute the given values into the formula: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)
Solving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.

","Thought: 
Let's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. 
Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 
The total amount is 8600, so we can set up the equation: 
5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = 8600
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and then we can find the amount each daughter receives by multiplying x by 4.
Action: 
First, simplify the equation: 
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 8600 / 43
x = 200
Each daughter receives 4x, so 4 * 200 = 800

If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",A,A,1,1524,57,1581,

","Thought: 
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ expands to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the coefficients on the left and right sides of the equation must be equal, we have $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$. 
Given that $a + b = 8$, we can substitute $b = 8 - a$ into the equation $ab = 15$ to get $a(8 - a) = 15$, which simplifies to $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$. 
Solving this quadratic equation gives $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. 
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 7*3 + 2*(8 - 3) = 31$ and $c = 7*5 + 2*(8 - 5) = 41$. 
So, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 . Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41 .Choice $A$ is incorrect; the numbers 3 and 5 are possible values for $a$ and $b$, but not possible values for $c$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; if $a=5$ and $b=3$, then 6 and 35 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(5 x+2)(3 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+35 x+6 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 6 and 35, the value of $c$ is 41 and not 6 and 35. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect; if $a=3$ and $b=5$, then 10 and 21 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(3 x+2)(5 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+21 x+10 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 10 and 21 , the value of $c$ is 31 and not 10 and 21 .",D,D,1,432,262,694,

","Thought: 
The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). 
If the line passes through the origin, the slope of the line is also equal to y / x for any point (x, y) on the line. 
So, we can set up the equation (32 - k) / (k - 2) = k / 2. 
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$. Therefore, of the given choices, only 8 could be the value of $k$.Choices $A, B$, and $D$ are incorrect and may be the result of computational errors.",D,C,0,418,112,530,

To find the value of x - y, we can subtract the second equation from the first. 
Subtracting the equations gives:
(2x - 3x) - (3y - 2y) = -14 - (-6)
-1x - 1y = -8
So, x - y = -8
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Multiplying each side of the equation $2 x-3 y=-14$ by 3 gives $6 x-9 y=-42$. Multiplying each side of the equation $3 x-2 y=-6$ by 2 gives $6 x-4 y=-12$. Then, subtracting the sides of $6 x-4 y=-12$ from the corresponding sides of $6 x-9 y=-42$ gives $-5 y=-30$. Dividing each side of the equation $-5 y=-30$ by -5 gives $y=6$. Finally, substituting 6 for $y$ in $2 x-3 y=-14$ gives $2 x-3(6)=-14$, or $x=2$. Therefore, the value of $x-y$ is $2-6=-4$.Alternatively, adding the corresponding sides of $2 x-3 y=-14$ and $3 x-2 y=-6$ gives $5 x-5 y=-20$, from which it follows that $x-y=-4$.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{B}$ are incorrect and may be the result of an arithmetic error when solving the system of equations.
