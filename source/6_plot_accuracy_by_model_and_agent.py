# Key Points : 


'''	1.	Parameters and File Handling: The script loads the results from a CSV file, with options to modify which model, agent, or exam to focus on. Output directories for saving plots are also set up.
	2.	Data Loading and Filtering: Results are loaded from the CSV file, and thereâ€™s an option to filter based on a specific exam for debugging purposes. In the default state, it filters out the "comprehensive-100" exam data.
	3.	Data Processing: Custom functions from the shared module are used to add baseline results, set titles for models and agents, and sort the data to make it ready for visualization.
	4.	Custom Color Palette: A custom Seaborn color palette is created, with a specific modification that swaps the last two colors for better distinction.
	5.	Plotting Accuracy: The first plot shows accuracy for each model, broken down by agent types using a bar plot. The plot is saved as a PDF and displayed.
	6.	Plotting Improvement: The second plot shows the improvement percentage for each model, also broken down by agent types. This plot is similarly saved and displayed.
	7.	Visualization Settings: The plots use various settings like rotated x-axis labels, adjusted margins, and custom legends to make the plots more readable and visually clear. '''
